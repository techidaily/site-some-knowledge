The Google Photos service allows you to store personal images in a virtual vault and makes that data accessible from any device you own.</p><p>Also included are various tools for organizing, viewing, altering, and finding your digital memories via the use of the service. Because it is the default picture app for Google’s Android operating system, it is available on most Android phones linked to your Google Account.</p><p>This comprehensive <strong>Google</strong> <strong>Video</strong> <strong>Editor</strong> tutorial has been compiled to assist you with your Google Photos navigation. Make sure you know everything about Google Video Editor before using it the next time! Let’s get this ball rolling!</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Google Photos?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Get Started with Google Photos?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Google Photos Video Editing Features</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How to Create Videos With Google Photos?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">How to Share Edited Videos from Google Photos?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Google-Photos"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Google-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Google Photos?"></a>Part 1: What is Google Photos?</h2><p>Google Photos is a platform for uploading, sharing, and storing digital photos. A year after its debut, it’s already a global phenomenon. And Google Photographs uses the term “the cloud” to refer to the online storage of your photos and videos.</p><p>If you had to do this in the past, you would have had to connect your phone or camera to a computer to upload your photographs and movies. You may have then backed up your PC to an external hard drive. But now, with Google Photos, the process is effortless and does not require a USB connection.</p><p>In addition to the benefits listed above, keeping your photographs and movies in the cloud has the following aspects:</p><ul><li>It has many options for organizing, using, sharing, and managing your photographs and videos.</li><li>It’s compatible with both iOS and Android devices.</li><li>Anyone can use Google Photos, regardless of their level of computer literacy. It’s easy to figure out where you are and how to go about.</li><li>The days of running out of space on your phone are long gone. You’ll be able to free up some space on your phone once you’ve uploaded your pictures and movies.</li><li>As long as you have an internet connection, you may view your photographs and videos from any device (phone, tablet, computer).</li><li>To share an album of images or videos with a friend or family member is easy.</li><li>Whenever you’re connected to Wi-Fi, you may schedule automatic backups to take place.</li><li>Storage space is provided at no cost to you. If you want your images to be preserved at their original resolution, you can pay, but you’ll probably be happy with the free version’s typical excellent quality. Compression is applied to images and movies with a resolution of more than 16MP. More on storage will be covered later.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Get-Started-with-Google-Photos"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Get-Started-with-Google-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Get Started with Google Photos?"></a>Part 2: How to Get Started with Google Photos?</h2><p>After you’ve installed the app on your smartphone, it’s time to get started with exploring the interface and the various editing options it contains.</p><p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>1</strong>: Launch the app and <strong>Sign In To Your Google Account.</strong> There is a good chance that you already have a Google account (such as Gmail). If you haven’t already, it’s fast and simple to join up.</p><p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2</strong>: Once you’ve logged in, all you have to do is <strong>follow the on-screen instructions</strong> to begin uploading your photographs and videos.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you have many photographs and videos, this may take some time. If you don’t want to waste your mobile data, make sure you’re connected to the internet through Wi-Fi.</p><p><strong><em>Photos, Search, Sharing</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Library</em></strong> are the three primary tabs at the bottom of the Google Photos program. If you’re using an iPhone&#x2F;iPad or an Android device, you’ll notice the app has a slightly different design. Let’s look into this in more depth:</p><p><strong>1. The Photos Tab</strong></p><p><strong>Photos</strong> is the first tab on the left-hand side of the screen. Memories from the past and the most current images may be found here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-photos-interface.jpg"                      alt="google photos photos interface"                ></p><p><strong>2. The Search Tab</strong></p><p>The <strong>Search</strong> tab appears next. You may use this search to find images of people, places, items on a map, or in a category. You may also see your own animations, collages, and movies in the gallery.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-search-interface.jpg"                      alt="google photos search interface"                ></p><p><strong>3. The Sharing Tab</strong></p><p>When you tap on the <strong>Sharing</strong> option, you have plenty of options. You can begin with the options of <strong>Create Shared Album</strong> and <strong>Share with Partner</strong>. You can <em>choose</em> <em>to</em> <strong><em>Share Some or All of Your Photos Automatically</em></strong>. Be it conversations or pictures. You have a good number of options here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-sharing-interface.jpg"                      alt="google photos sharing interface"                ></p><p><strong>4. The Library Tab</strong></p><p>The <strong>Library</strong> tab is the third one on the left-hand side. Your <strong>Albums</strong>, <strong>Favorites</strong> and <strong>Archive</strong> are all here, as well as your Trash.</p><p>The <strong>Utilities</strong> menu includes tools for animating, collaging, and creating movies. By tapping on a picture, you may see the photo in its entirety. You may also access the editing and sharing options for a picture in this manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-library-interface.jpg"                      alt="google photos library interface"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Google-Photos-Video-Editing-Features"><a href="#Part-3-Google-Photos-Video-Editing-Features" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Google Photos Video Editing Features"></a>Part 3: Google Photos Video Editing Features</h2><p>We’re introducing some of the editing tools already accessible on Pixel to Google Photos Video Editor users as part of their subscription starting today.</p><p>These machine learning effects modify your photos: with <strong><em>Portrait Blur</em></strong>, you can blur the backdrop post-snap, and with <strong><em>Portrait Light</em></strong>, you can increase the lighting on faces in portraits.</p><p>Both capabilities would work for recent and past photographs, even if the original image was not captured in portrait mode.</p><p><strong><em>Blur</em></strong> and <strong><em>Color Pop</em></strong> is still available for photographs with depth information (such as those taken in portrait mode), and anybody with Google Photos may use them for free.</p><p>According to today’s upgrade, Google Photo Video Editor users may now apply similar effects to even more images of people, even those that lack depth information, such as vintage film scans or professional shots.</p><p>Members of Google Photos Video Editor will also access new machine <strong><em>learning-powered effects.</em></strong> Consider them super filters that can make sophisticated adjustments with a single press.</p><p>You may use the <strong><em>Dynamic</em></strong> suggestion to boost <strong>Brightness</strong> and <strong>Contrast</strong> throughout the picture where it’s required, resulting in a more dramatic, balanced picture.</p><p>With <strong>Sky</strong> recommendations, you can make your golden hour photographs stand out by enhancing and altering the color and contrast in the sky using one of many <strong>Themes</strong> inspired by magnificent sunrises and sunsets.</p><p>Besides, other editing features such as <strong><em>Adjust, Trim, Cut, Slider, Filters, Color Focus, Skin Tone, Focus, HDR, Portrait Light</em></strong>, etc. are some of the basic editing features you get in Google Video Editor Online.</p><p>Let’s take a deep look into how you can apply these effects to your video:</p><p><strong>1. Crop and Rotate video in Google Photos</strong></p><p>Tap on the <strong>Crop</strong> option and select the different <strong>Aspect Ratios</strong> to start with.

To begin, you’ll need to <strong>Sign In</strong> using your Gmail Account if you’ve previously enrolled.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select <strong>Library</strong> from the drop-down menu in the lower right corner of your mobile device’s display. Scroll down to <strong>Utilities</strong> and click on it. <strong>Animation</strong>, <strong>Collage,</strong> and <strong>Movie</strong> are all included in the <strong>Create New</strong> section. As this instruction is about making a movie, the <strong>Movie</strong> button will be selected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-videos-google-photos-library.jpg"                      alt="create videos google photos library"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choosing a movie theme on the “Create Movie” tab or creating a new standard movie is the only option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-movie-google-photos.jpg"                      alt="create movie google photos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: When making a video, now you may choose from up to 50 images and clips.

A year after its debut, it’s already a global phenomenon. And Google Photographs uses the term “the cloud” to refer to the online storage of your photos and videos.</p><p>If you had to do this in the past, you would have had to connect your phone or camera to a computer to upload your photographs and movies. You may have then backed up your PC to an external hard drive. But now, with Google Photos, the process is effortless and does not require a USB connection.</p><p>In addition to the benefits listed above, keeping your photographs and movies in the cloud has the following aspects:</p><ul><li>It has many options for organizing, using, sharing, and managing your photographs and videos.</li><li>It’s compatible with both iOS and Android devices.</li><li>Anyone can use Google Photos, regardless of their level of computer literacy. It’s easy to figure out where you are and how to go about.</li><li>The days of running out of space on your phone are long gone. You’ll be able to free up some space on your phone once you’ve uploaded your pictures and movies.</li><li>As long as you have an internet connection, you may view your photographs and videos from any device (phone, tablet, computer).</li><li>To share an album of images or videos with a friend or family member is easy.</li><li>Whenever you’re connected to Wi-Fi, you may schedule automatic backups to take place.</li><li>Storage space is provided at no cost to you. If you want your images to be preserved at their original resolution, you can pay, but you’ll probably be happy with the free version’s typical excellent quality. Compression is applied to images and movies with a resolution of more than 16MP. More on storage will be covered later.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Get-Started-with-Google-Photos-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Get-Started-with-Google-Photos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Get Started with Google Photos?"></a>Part 2: How to Get Started with Google Photos?</h2><p>After you’ve installed the app on your smartphone, it’s time to get started with exploring the interface and the various editing options it contains.</p><p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>1</strong>: Launch the app and <strong>Sign In To Your Google Account.</strong> There is a good chance that you already have a Google account (such as Gmail). If you haven’t already, it’s fast and simple to join up.</p><p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2</strong>: Once you’ve logged in, all you have to do is <strong>follow the on-screen instructions</strong> to begin uploading your photographs and videos.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you have many photographs and videos, this may take some time. If you don’t want to waste your mobile data, make sure you’re connected to the internet through Wi-Fi.</p><p><strong><em>Photos, Search, Sharing</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Library</em></strong> are the three primary tabs at the bottom of the Google Photos program.

The Photos Tab</strong></p><p><strong>Photos</strong> is the first tab on the left-hand side of the screen.

The Search Tab</strong></p><p>The <strong>Search</strong> tab appears next. You may use this search to find images of people, places, items on a map, or in a category. You may also see your own animations, collages, and movies in the gallery.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-search-interface.jpg"                      alt="google photos search interface"                ></p><p><strong>3.

When it is bright outside a window is as powerful as any light you might have. So, besides just being cheap, windows can actually make your YouTube videos look amazing.</p><h4 id="1-Windows-as-Key-Lights"><a href="#1-Windows-as-Key-Lights" class="headerlink" title="1.

Your key light, in this case your window, is off to one side. It will cast a shadow over half of your face which you soften using your fill light. Your backlight is a light you put behind you to help you pop out of your background.</p><p> Another thing that can help you pop out from your background is focusing your keylight so that its light is only landing on you, not your background.</p><p> Rather than setting up professional lights for your fill and backlights try using household lamps or reflectors. Reflectors are used to bounce light from another source, so if you set one up opposite to the window it will redirect light back at the shaded side of your face.</p><p> Reflectors are very affordable, often around $20, but if you do not have one then you can use a sheet of aluminum foil.</p><h4 id="2-Windows-as-Front-Lights"><a href="#2-Windows-as-Front-Lights" class="headerlink" title="2.

This is not difficult to get around; you just need a backlight.</p><p> You can use a household lamp or a reflector as a backlight. The idea is that the light hitting you from behind will create a boarder around you that will make you pop out from the background of your shot.</p><h4 id="3-Windows-as-Backlights"><a href="#3-Windows-as-Backlights" class="headerlink" title="3. Windows as Backlights"></a>3. Windows as Backlights</h4><p> It is usually a bad idea to use a window as a backlight because they are too bright. Shooting with a window behind you will not just give you a dark boarder, like a lamp or a reflector; it will completely transform you into a silhouette. This is an interesting effect in some situations, but not in a vlog where your viewers are expecting to be able to see you. It is sometimes possible to make this kind of shot work by increasing your exposure, but then you might end up with over-exposed footage.

The light coming from your window might be hard on your eyes, and setting up a diffuser between you and your window can help you not to blink. Often when reflectors come in colored sets one of the ‘colors’ will be translucent and you can use it as a diffuser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> A great looking vlog is a well-lit vlog.

They’re also easy to mount on almost any surface i-e., mounting onto your bike helmet makes it easy to capture every moment on your ride, so that it doesn’t matter where you are, you’ll be able to capture what’s happening around you.</p><p>GoPro time-lapse is a way to view the world from your camera’s point of view. It allows you to see everything that happened in a short period, either as it happens or over several days. You can use GoPro time-lapse to make videos about your daily life, or even about events like weddings, and vacations. You can use GoPro time-lapse for a more serious purpose.</p><p>There are many different cameras available on the market today that will work with GoPro time-lapse. Time-lapse videos are filmed at a constant speed and then edited together to create a video that shows the passage of time in real-time. In this blog post, we’ll explore why GoPro time-lapse is important, and how it can help you capture your memories.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-GoPro-Time-lapse-Video-Mode"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-GoPro-Time-lapse-Video-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is GoPro Time-lapse Video Mode"></a>Part 1: What is GoPro Time-lapse Video Mode</h2><p>GoPro time-lapse video mode allows you to create a video that shows the passage of time over a period of days or weeks. The video is created by taking photos at regular intervals and then editing them together so that they appear to run in real-time. One of the most popular uses of GoPro time-lapse videos is when you want to capture something in motion.</p><p>You can use this technique for many different types of subjects including landscapes, cars, people, and animals and you can even add sounds like birds chirping or waves crashing along with them! It’s also possible to make this type of video if you’re using any other camera brand than GoPro itself. This method produces high-quality videos that can be used as promotional material.</p><p>The GoPro time-lapse creates the final video by stitching together the individual still images into one long clip. The software also allows you to manipulate each frame individually, which can be used to adjust the focus and exposure settings of your shot. GoPro Time-lapse videos are videos that show a sequence of events over a substantial period.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/gopro-timelapse-video-mode.jpg"                      alt="gopro timelapse video mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-GoPro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-GoPro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with GoPro"></a>Part 2: How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with GoPro</h2><p>If you’re a videographer or photographer, you’ve probably considered shooting time-lapse videos.

Use <strong>Microsoft speech to text</strong> service. This service was launched in 2020 alongside the text-to-speech service, which includes famous computer-generated voices like <strong>Microsoft Sam</strong> and his brother, Mike. So, in this short read, you’ll learn what <strong>Microsoft Azure speech to text</strong> service is and its capabilities. I’ll also introduce you to the best Microsoft Azure STT alternatives. Let’s hunker down!</p><p><strong>Top Alternative to Microsoft Azure STT</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?"></a>Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?</h2><p>Microsoft Azure STT and TTS are part of <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. These cognitive services feature state-of-the-art intelligence covering voice recognition, speaker recognition, machine translation, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The Microsoft speech to text service uses Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) to auto-recognize, analyze, and convert human voices to editable and searchable texts.</p><p>Having said that, Azure STT lets you transcribe streaming audio, microphone commentary, or local audio files. It supports 100+ languages, including English, German, French, Swahili, Hindi, Ukrainian, Turkish, Arabic, and more. Remember that this service also supports batch transcription, allowing you to transcribe multiple audios in batch.</p><p>In the meantime, Azure STT is available in many formats, including Speech SDK. Speech SDK (Software Development Kit) allows you to use popular programming languages to create a speech-enabled application. It’s compatible with Java, JavaScript, Python, Visual Studio C++, Swift, and Objective-C.</p><p>If you’re not good with programming languages, use Speech CLI, a command tool that allows you to use the speech recognition service without entering a code. Put simply, it features a minimal setup with precise requirements. Plus, it features pretty much everything you’ll find in Speech SDK. So, it depends on your skills and preference.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Azure Speech Studio supports keyword recognition or keyword spotting. You can generate keyword recognition models and specify any short phrase or word. Users can also personalize keywords with the correct punctuations. And best of all, there is no extra cost for customizing keywords.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio"></a>Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio</h2><p>Now let’s learn how to use Microsoft Azure speech recognition services. Remember, the conversion may not be accurate if the audio has lots of domain-industry jargon or ambient noises. Therefore, use crisp-clear audio with an external mic or train the software to recognize specific words or keywords. Let’s get started!</p><p>Step1Start by creating a Microsoft Azure account. You’ll start with the free version, which gives you a <strong>$200 credit to use within 30 days</strong>. After depleting the free credits, use the pay-as-you-go model, which unlocks 40+ Azure services.</p><p>Step2After creating a Microsoft Azure portal, you’ll see all Azure services. Click the Speech Services tab or search for “speech services” on the search bar. Now click Create and then fill out the project details. Then, click Review and Create before clicking Create.</p><p>Step3The program will take a while to deploy an instance. Now tap Keys and endpoints on the left pane and copy the key and region identifier as you may need them later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-speech-to-text-1.jpg"                      alt="micrsoft azure speech to text copy key and region"                ></p><p>Step4Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ and .NET Core 3.1 Runtime. Next, install Speech CL on .NET by running this command “**dotnet tool install -global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI.**” Alternatively, download and install Speech CLI for Windows PCs as a <a class="link"   href="https://aka.ms/speech/spx-windows" >ZIP file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step5Now enter the Azure regional identifier and subscription key on Windows Terminal or PowerShell. To configure the region and key, run these commands; “<strong>spx config @key –set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY</strong> and **spx config @region –set REGION.**”</p><p>Step6Now it’s time to convert speech to text using Azure STT Service. To do that, run “<strong>spx recognize -microphone</strong>” on Terminal or PowerShell. Azure Speech CLI will listen to sound input and convert it to text. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                      alt="icon note"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Click <a class="link"   href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/one-dev-minute/how-to-use-the-azure-cognitive-services-net-speech-sdk-for-recognition" >this video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a detailed guide on how to use Azure Speech Services with Visual Basic (SDK).</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-the-Free-Alternatives-to-the-Microsoft-Speech-to-Text-Service"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-the-Free-Alternatives-to-the-Microsoft-Speech-to-Text-Service" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Are the Free Alternatives to the Microsoft Speech to Text Service?"></a>Part 3: What Are the Free Alternatives to the Microsoft Speech to Text Service?</h2><p>We should all agree that using Microsoft Azures Speech Service is not a walk in the park. You need some knowledge of programming and Windows Command Prompt. Even worse, you’ll have to pay each time you want to convert speech to text after depleting the free credits.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s no shortage of free speech to text converters for beginners. So, in this part, we’ll discuss some free Microsoft Azure STT alternatives for beginners.</p><h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

It’s a video editor for creating award-winning videos without prior editing skills. Just upload your local video and edit it as you please. And yes, it works with a host of video formats.</p><p>When you want to make perfect videos, you can use Filmora’s STT feature. Wondershare Filmora Speech to Text is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms&#x2F;stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production. For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>What’s more, now Filmora’s STT feature supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles with up to 27 languages of transcription in Filmora.</p><h3 id="Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT"><a href="#Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT" class="headerlink" title="Top Adavantages of Filmora STT"></a>Top Adavantages of Filmora STT</h3><ul><li>Supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles.</li><li>Allows to transcribe video speech to text in one click.</li><li>Boosts editing efficiency by applying the STT feature.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make STT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make STT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="Use-Filmora-To-Make-STT-videos"><a href="#Use-Filmora-To-Make-STT-videos" class="headerlink" title="Use Filmora To Make STT videos"></a>Use Filmora To Make STT videos</h3><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Select the audio asset in the timeline, and click the “Speech-to-Text” icon in the toolbar; if there is no supported file type on the timeline, it will not be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/guide-win/toolbar-stt.jpg"                      alt="toolbar stt"                ></p><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Click the “Speech-to-Text” icon, and it will show the parameter settings.

Most of you may not be aware that Google Docs can accurately convert speech to text. This makes it a handy tool if you find speaking easier than writing. As expected, this voice transcription tool recognizes hundreds of languages, like English, French, Italian, Hindi, etc.</p><p>But although it does a commendable job, less-than-clear audio won’t give you accurate transcriptions. Also, it doesn’t feature niceties like periods, commas, and other punctuations. As such, stick to a professional app like Filmora to transcribe your audio to text.</p><p>Steps to convert voice to text with Google Docs:</p><p>Step1Open a new document on Google Docs and then click Voice typing. The inbuilt microphone will automatically launch.</p><p>Step2Next, click the language drop-down arrow on the microphone to choose the transcription language. You can dictate texts in English, Espanol, French, Italian, Afrikaans, Arabic, and more.</p><p>Step3Click the Microphone icon to start dictating texts on Google Docs. After dictating enough texts, tap the red Microphone icon and edit your text. It’s that simple!</p><h3 id="3-Audtext-60-one-time-fee"><a href="#3-Audtext-60-one-time-fee" class="headerlink" title="3.Audtext - $60 one-time fee"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://audext.com/" >Audtext <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - $60 one-time fee</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-speech-to-text-7.jpg"                      alt="micrsoft azure speech to text alternative audtext"                ></p><p>If Google’s voice recognition service is too slow for your liking, consider Audtext. It’s a highly rated online program that uses cutting-edge machine learning technology to transcribe audio to text in 60+ languages. You can easily train this program to identify the speaker in your interview or podcast file.</p><p>Meanwhile, Audtext can transcribe typical video and audio formats, including MP3, WAV, M4A, MP4, MOV, and more. And after transcribing audio to text, exploit the inbuilt text editor to retouch and make your text presentable.</p><p>Let’s find out how this STT service works:</p><p>Step1Create a transcription account on Audtext and click New Upload to choose the transcription mode. You can select the automatic transcription that uses AI or professional real-human transcription. So, let’s choose Automatic.</p><p>Step2Drag-n-drop your video or audio file on the program and then choose the transcription language. After adding your file, click Upload to scan and transcribe it. This should take a while.</p><p>Step3Finally, click the transcribed text file to edit it with new texts and punctuations on the inbuilt editor. You can export your transcription in .txt, .srt, or .docx formats. Directly export to Google Drive is also available.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Up to this point, you should be ready to get started with the <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. The speech-to-text feature allows you to convert unlimited voices to text on your computer. However, the program can be challenging to set up if you’re not a techie.</p><p>In that case, use a more straightforward option like Google Docs to dictate texts on the text editor.

For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>What’s more, now Filmora’s STT feature supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles with up to 27 languages of transcription in Filmora.</p><h3 id="Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT-1"><a href="#Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT-1" class="headerlink" title="Top Adavantages of Filmora STT"></a>Top Adavantages of Filmora STT</h3><ul><li>Supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles.</li><li>Allows to transcribe video speech to text in one click.</li><li>Boosts editing efficiency by applying the STT feature.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make STT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make STT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="Use-Filmora-To-Make-STT-videos-1"><a href="#Use-Filmora-To-Make-STT-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Filmora To Make STT videos"></a>Use Filmora To Make STT videos</h3><h5 id="Step-1-1"><a href="#Step-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Select the audio asset in the timeline, and click the “Speech-to-Text” icon in the toolbar; if there is no supported file type on the timeline, it will not be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/guide-win/toolbar-stt.jpg"                      alt="toolbar stt"                ></p><h5 id="Step-2-1"><a href="#Step-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Click the “Speech-to-Text” icon, and it will show the parameter settings.

Most of you may not be aware that Google Docs can accurately convert speech to text. This makes it a handy tool if you find speaking easier than writing. As expected, this voice transcription tool recognizes hundreds of languages, like English, French, Italian, Hindi, etc.</p><p>But although it does a commendable job, less-than-clear audio won’t give you accurate transcriptions. Also, it doesn’t feature niceties like periods, commas, and other punctuations. As such, stick to a professional app like Filmora to transcribe your audio to text.</p><p>Steps to convert voice to text with Google Docs:</p><p>Step1Open a new document on Google Docs and then click Voice typing. The inbuilt microphone will automatically launch.</p><p>Step2Next, click the language drop-down arrow on the microphone to choose the transcription language. You can dictate texts in English, Espanol, French, Italian, Afrikaans, Arabic, and more.</p><p>Step3Click the Microphone icon to start dictating texts on Google Docs. After dictating enough texts, tap the red Microphone icon and edit your text. It’s that simple!</p><h3 id="3-Audtext-60-one-time-fee-1"><a href="#3-Audtext-60-one-time-fee-1" class="headerlink" title="3.Audtext - $60 one-time fee"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://audext.com/" >Audtext <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - $60 one-time fee</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-speech-to-text-7.jpg"                      alt="micrsoft azure speech to text alternative audtext"                ></p><p>If Google’s voice recognition service is too slow for your liking, consider Audtext. It’s a highly rated online program that uses cutting-edge machine learning technology to transcribe audio to text in 60+ languages. You can easily train this program to identify the speaker in your interview or podcast file.</p><p>Meanwhile, Audtext can transcribe typical video and audio formats, including MP3, WAV, M4A, MP4, MOV, and more. And after transcribing audio to text, exploit the inbuilt text editor to retouch and make your text presentable.</p><p>Let’s find out how this STT service works:</p><p>Step1Create a transcription account on Audtext and click New Upload to choose the transcription mode. You can select the automatic transcription that uses AI or professional real-human transcription. So, let’s choose Automatic.</p><p>Step2Drag-n-drop your video or audio file on the program and then choose the transcription language. After adding your file, click Upload to scan and transcribe it. This should take a while.</p><p>Step3Finally, click the transcribed text file to edit it with new texts and punctuations on the inbuilt editor. You can export your transcription in .txt, .srt, or .docx formats. Directly export to Google Drive is also available.</p><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Up to this point, you should be ready to get started with the <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. The speech-to-text feature allows you to convert unlimited voices to text on your computer. However, the program can be challenging to set up if you’re not a techie.</p><p>In that case, use a more straightforward option like Google Docs to dictate texts on the text editor.

There are loads of romantic songs out there, so picking the right one for your marry me song can be hard. Let us help to inspire you with our pick of the 10 best proposal songs out there, tried and tested by lovers all over the world.</p><h4 id="1-Perfect-Ed-Sheeran-3"><a href="#1-Perfect-Ed-Sheeran-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Perfect - Ed Sheeran"></a>1. Perfect - Ed Sheeran</h4><p>Dear Mr. Sheeran has graced us with bucket loads of potential marriage proposal songs, but if we had to pick one, it would definitely be ‘Perfect’. From the lilting melodies to the meaning behind the words, it’s just beautiful from start to finish and perfect for setting the mood.</p><h4 id="2-Marry-you-Bruno-Mars-3"><a href="#2-Marry-you-Bruno-Mars-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Marry you - Bruno Mars"></a>2. Marry you - Bruno Mars</h4><p>It’s a bit more upbeat than many of the best proposal songs, but does that mean it’s not awesome? No. Marry you is a happy, fun and simple soundtrack to a proposal, without being too mushy or overly sappy.</p><h4 id="3-Make-you-feel-my-love-Adele-3"><a href="#3-Make-you-feel-my-love-Adele-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Make you feel my love - Adele"></a>3. Make you feel my love - Adele</h4><p>Simply one of the best songs of all time, let alone the best proposal songs, the haunting lyrics of Adele coupled with the ultra-romantic lyrics are sure to set any heart aflutter. The original purveyor of romantic songs, Bob Dylan, actually wrote the words, but we prefer Adele’s dulcet vocals for your perfect marry me song.</p><h4 id="4-All-of-me-John-Legend-3"><a href="#4-All-of-me-John-Legend-3" class="headerlink" title="4. All of me - John Legend"></a>4. All of me - John Legend</h4><p>If you’ve ever experienced the feeling of dizzying, overwhelming euphoria when you’re with your lover, you’ll feel an absolute affinity with the lyrics of this song. All your curves and all your edges, all your perfect imperfections… one of the most romantic love songs ever.</p><h4 id="5-Better-together-Jack-Johnson-3"><a href="#5-Better-together-Jack-Johnson-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Better together - Jack Johnson"></a>5. Better together - Jack Johnson</h4><p>Jack Johnson just oozes romance. His voice is like a bar of chocolate smothered in Champagne and topped with fillet steak. And when you add that to the words of this, one of the best proposal songs in history, we think you’ve got something really special.</p><h4 id="6-Truly-madly-deeply-Savage-Garden-3"><a href="#6-Truly-madly-deeply-Savage-Garden-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Truly madly deeply - Savage Garden"></a>6. Truly madly deeply - Savage Garden</h4><p>Do you want to stand with your loved one on a mountain? Do you want to bathe with them in the sea? This song really says it all and is a perfect choice of marriage proposal songs for you and your loved one to get all squishy to.</p><h4 id="7-Let’s-stay-together-Al-Green-3"><a href="#7-Let’s-stay-together-Al-Green-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Let’s stay together - Al Green"></a>7. Let’s stay together - Al Green</h4><p>Some things never need to be changed, and this 1972 Motown classic is still as relevant today as it was 40 years ago. A bit more upbeat, which is good if you’re not so into gushing romantic songs, but still very meaningful and lovely to propose to.</p><h4 id="8-I-swear-All-4-One-3"><a href="#8-I-swear-All-4-One-3" class="headerlink" title="8. I swear - All-4-One"></a>8. I swear - All-4-One</h4><p>American R&amp;B and pop group, All-4-One, are definitely best known for their hit single ‘I swear’. It’s a perfect encapsulation of love and adoration, describing so many happy relationships in perfect vocal harmony. An ideal marry me song if ever we heard one!</p><h4 id="9-I-love-you-always-forever-Donna-Lewis-3"><a href="#9-I-love-you-always-forever-Donna-Lewis-3" class="headerlink" title="9. I love you always forever - Donna Lewis"></a>9. I love you always forever - Donna Lewis</h4><p>This is one of those songs you can both enjoy a bop or a slow dance to, perfectly merging the best of romantic love songs with upbeat pop fun. It’s a good one to blend into the background rather than taking over the moment, and yet the lyrics say it all.</p><h4 id="10-Every-little-thing-she-does-is-magic-the-Police-3"><a href="#10-Every-little-thing-she-does-is-magic-the-Police-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Every little thing she does is magic - the Police"></a>10. Every little thing she does is magic - the Police</h4><p>A true classic by the master of lyrics, this Police hit is an alternative choice of marriage proposal songs, simply highlighting how truly awesome your loved one really is. It’s one you could have a little jiggle to, then surprise her with a drop to one knee at the slow part.</p><p>When it comes to marriage proposal songs, your own experience and time together has to play a big part. If there’s a song that means a lot to both of you, maybe to do with how you met or something that happened together, but it’s not on the list, then absolutely it should be a contender for your marry me song.

You may gradually raise or lower the level of audio events or audio clips by using fade ins and fade outs. Event-based or clip-based fade ins and fade outs are also possible. In this situation, the fade feature in a sequencer or audio editor may often be utilized swiftly and efficiently.</p><p>A video transition is comparable to an audio fade. There is often a sweet spot when the fading truly disappears. You often have a choice of fade curves with fade functions. Using the faders on a mixer, whether it be hardware or software, is the most natural method to fade. All current software sequencers will capture your motions, allowing you to modify, fade, and tune until you find the perfect rhythm. Keep fade-ins brief in most situations unless you’re going for a specific impact.</p><h3 id="What-is-Crossfade"><a href="#What-is-Crossfade" class="headerlink" title="What is Crossfade?"></a>What is Crossfade?</h3><p>Adding an audio transition between two adjacent audio clips on the same track creates a crossfade. You may apply a crossfade transition to either end of a single clip to have it fade in or fade out. A crossfade is the technique of fading one piece of audio out while also fading the other one in, unlike a fade, which is conducted on only one piece of audio. The sound engine’s maximum crossfade time when switching from Sound A to Sound B is equal to half the duration of Audio File A.</p><p>You may use crossfades to provide seamless transitions between several audio events on the same track. Crossfading is always depending on events. You may manually carry out a crossfade, just as with fades. The two songs’ blended versions must be routed to two distinct sets of faders. Only when the subsequent events or their corresponding clips overlap can crossfades be made. This is typically used in recording to make one track on an album fade into or blend with the next. When done well, it has a fantastic impact.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Crossfade Audio"></a>Part 2.

Don’t always think about the money and the free product, but think about how you can do your job well without faking your reaction.</p><p>Every video you post need to bring value to your viewers. You might really want to create branded content and build a partnership, but if the content you produce doesn’t line up with your brand, your audience won’t care about it and even your channel and the brand will suffer at the end.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Brand Collaboration may benefit your channel and also the brand itself, the end goal may still be to sell but business must address consumers differently, transform them first into an audience, then ask permission to distill your marketing message into meaningful content. Brand should also be listening carefully to their audience responding to their comments, questions and suggestions.</p><p>When doing a brand collaboration, you must remember don’t lose hope, your first few attempts might not return anything.

The most straight forward what to do this is to contact brand directly.</p><p>You can always send an email to the brands you are sighting that you think you can work with. Must remember each and every email should be super personalized, each and every email should have a crisp and neat introduction about yourself. Who you are, where you’re from, how you started and where you are now? The email should also explain how the brand can benefit by sponsoring to your channel. Also show them that you have a plan to make collaboration beneficial not just to you but also for the brand.</p><p>Brand already know that creator can benefit through the collaborations.

But you need to invest, if you want to get the attention of the brand you want to collaborate your need to purchased first on their product and make a good review and video presentation about the product so that you can show them when you want to email them.</p><p>In order for you to make a nice video you have to have a great video editing software that you will use to make your video presentation nice and creative.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-video-presentation.jpg"                      alt="create video presentation"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great choice because of its wonderful features that use by most video editing professionals as well as content creator.

Don’t always think about the money and the free product, but think about how you can do your job well without faking your reaction.</p><p>Every video you post need to bring value to your viewers. You might really want to create branded content and build a partnership, but if the content you produce doesn’t line up with your brand, your audience won’t care about it and even your channel and the brand will suffer at the end.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Brand Collaboration may benefit your channel and also the brand itself, the end goal may still be to sell but business must address consumers differently, transform them first into an audience, then ask permission to distill your marketing message into meaningful content. Brand should also be listening carefully to their audience responding to their comments, questions and suggestions.</p><p>When doing a brand collaboration, you must remember don’t lose hope, your first few attempts might not return anything. Keep trying and keep making awesome content. Bigger the following, easier it is to get sponsorship. Just focus on your goal and don’t be disappointed you might get what your dream of in the perfect time.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Harmonizing-Designs-Using-Color-Principles-Wisely"><a href="#Harmonizing-Designs-Using-Color-Principles-Wisely" class="headerlink" title="Harmonizing Designs: Using Color Principles Wisely"></a>Harmonizing Designs: Using Color Principles Wisely</h2><p>So, you’ve heard about color theory but don’t know what it is or how to use it and you may also be wondering what color theory could possibly have to do with you. We are talking about the theory of all color combinations and how they can be altered or selected to better work together creating a more pleasant viewing for your audience.</p><p>If you are more selective with your colors in your videos or imagery the viewer will find this aesthetically pleasing and may be more engaged in your content. This includes anything from logo design all the way to props for your shot. When creating your videos within Filmora it is good practice to think about your composition in all aspects including color theory and with the guide hopefully you will have a better understanding of how you can influence your color palette.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Color-Theory"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Theory" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Theory"></a>What Is Color Theory</h2><p>Color theory consists of many elements that could fill a library on its own but for this guide we will focus on two key elements. The color wheel and color harmony. By understanding the color wheel and color harmony you can hand pick which colors to add or use in your pieces to create a well-balanced viewing experience which can help in viewer engagement and enjoyment.</p><p>There are many color wheels out there and all require understanding and research into that particular color arrangement but for this guide I will be focusing on the more widely used RGB which derives from the primary colors red green and blue, If you’re thinking why red green and blue not red yellow and blue then you are observant, while RYB is taught as the three primary colors we will be using what is known as additive primary colors of light meaning the more you add of these colors the closer to white you get, the reason we will be using this combination is due to the fact RYB misses a lot of hues around the violet area and the blue-greens meaning we achieve a higher range of color to pick from. With this in mind let’s start.</p><h2 id="The-Color-Wheel"><a href="#The-Color-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="The Color Wheel"></a>The Color Wheel</h2><p>Using red, green and blue as primary colors we can mix the colors to one another to get our secondary colors giving us yellow, magenta and cyan. We can mix these to one another to create our tertiary colors which are raspberry, orange, sprig green, turquoise, ocean and violet giving us something which looks like this</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/color-wheel.jpg"                      alt="colcor wheel"                ></p><p>As you can see, we have every color available in this wheel and they are arranged in a unison with the mixed colors starting with red, green and blue and working towards each other.</p><h2 id="Color-Harmony"><a href="#Color-Harmony" class="headerlink" title="Color Harmony"></a>Color Harmony</h2><p>So now we know how the wheel is made and what it looks like. What does it do? We can use this wheel now to gather our palette. Within color theory we talk about harmonious colors that work together in a pleasant way creating less stress on the eyes to find information in your scene.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-harmony.jpg"                      alt="color harmony"                ></p><p>One such harmony is complementary colors and luckily for us this is very easy to find. You take your base color and find the opposite color on the wheel. In this example the complementary color to blue is yellow depicted with a red line.</p><p>These colors always work as they create contrast and stability.</p><p>The blue lines represent what is known as split contrasting colors and these will create balance with each other.</p><p>The corners of the black rectangle land on what is known as tetradic complement and allows you to add four colors with the understanding that they will complement each other perfectly. Lastly is the purple line which represents the analogous complementary colors, you can pick these neighboring colors with the peace of mind that they will harmonize with each other. There are many more but these four are the main ones that you will use more often than any other, by selecting colors using these four main types you can create a palette for your scenes and allow the viewer to effortlessly enjoy your content. These types work no matter where you start from on the wheel so long as you keep the distances the same.</p><h2 id="But-How-Do-I-Use-This"><a href="#But-How-Do-I-Use-This" class="headerlink" title="But How Do I Use This"></a>But How Do I Use This</h2><p>You may still be unsure as to how to implement color theory into your videos. Let’s look at some scenarios that color theory may help your creations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-color-theory-video.jpg"                      alt="apply color theory video"                ></p><p>In this scene the director decided that the backdrop should complement the top the actor is wearing, looking at our wheel we can see the complementary color would be dark purple so they started with that, to create a more dynamic scene they then used the analogous colors of that purple being pink and red and created the backdrop. This creates a harmony within the scene and makes it effortless to see all the key elements straight away.</p><p>As you can see from this example the base color for the scene is a dark blue&#x2F;purple and using the analogous color of pink they created a point of interest within the scene that doesn’t look out of place. This is a very good way to pull the viewers eyes towards something you want them to take in above all else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/movie-cover-with-color-theory.jpg"                      alt="movie cover with color theory"                ></p><p>As you can see from all the movie covers above, they all use complementary colors from the blues to the war yellows and oranges, this creates high contrast and balance and is something done within the movie industry in every scene. It’s no coincidence that the joker is purple and green or that the iron man is red and gold, this is well prepared and researched in the planning stages of everything a visual artist creates.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>By including this into your thought process when creating videos with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will achieve well balanced and harmonious content for your viewer to enjoy and create better engagement. It’s not by chance these things happen though, it’s through research and planning that the most iconic scenes and characters are created and this is just one small brick in the foundations of content creation. With practice this will become second nature to you and that is the main goal of this guide.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-gaming-masterpiece-samsungs-ue590-in-depth-review/"><u>[New] Gaming Masterpiece - Samsung's UE590 In-Depth Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-extensive-investigation-the-future-of-panorama-cams-with-samsung/"><u>In 2024, Extensive Investigation  The Future of Panorama Cams with Samsung</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-go-big-or-go-home-selecting-the-most-satisfying-1tbplus-cloud-services/"><u>[Updated] Go Big or Go Home - Selecting the Most Satisfying 1TB+ Cloud Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/gopro-editing-software-15-best-gopro-video-editors-for-2024/"><u>GoPro Editing Software  15 Best GoPro Video Editors for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-from-newbie-to-zoom-whiz-in-no-time/"><u>[New] From Newbie to Zoom Whiz in No Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-immersive-worlds-confrontation-metaverse-vs-omniverse-explored/"><u>[Updated] Immersive Worlds Confrontation  Metaverse Vs.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Harmonious-Hues-Mastering-Color-Dynamics"><a href="#Harmonious-Hues-Mastering-Color-Dynamics" class="headerlink" title="Harmonious Hues: Mastering Color Dynamics"></a>Harmonious Hues: Mastering Color Dynamics</h2><p>So, you’ve heard about color theory but don’t know what it is or how to use it and you may also be wondering what color theory could possibly have to do with you. We are talking about the theory of all color combinations and how they can be altered or selected to better work together creating a more pleasant viewing for your audience.</p><p>If you are more selective with your colors in your videos or imagery the viewer will find this aesthetically pleasing and may be more engaged in your content. This includes anything from logo design all the way to props for your shot. When creating your videos within Filmora it is good practice to think about your composition in all aspects including color theory and with the guide hopefully you will have a better understanding of how you can influence your color palette.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Color-Theory"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Theory" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Theory"></a>What Is Color Theory</h2><p>Color theory consists of many elements that could fill a library on its own but for this guide we will focus on two key elements. The color wheel and color harmony. By understanding the color wheel and color harmony you can hand pick which colors to add or use in your pieces to create a well-balanced viewing experience which can help in viewer engagement and enjoyment.</p><p>There are many color wheels out there and all require understanding and research into that particular color arrangement but for this guide I will be focusing on the more widely used RGB which derives from the primary colors red green and blue, If you’re thinking why red green and blue not red yellow and blue then you are observant, while RYB is taught as the three primary colors we will be using what is known as additive primary colors of light meaning the more you add of these colors the closer to white you get, the reason we will be using this combination is due to the fact RYB misses a lot of hues around the violet area and the blue-greens meaning we achieve a higher range of color to pick from. With this in mind let’s start.</p><h2 id="The-Color-Wheel"><a href="#The-Color-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="The Color Wheel"></a>The Color Wheel</h2><p>Using red, green and blue as primary colors we can mix the colors to one another to get our secondary colors giving us yellow, magenta and cyan. We can mix these to one another to create our tertiary colors which are raspberry, orange, sprig green, turquoise, ocean and violet giving us something which looks like this</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/color-wheel.jpg"                      alt="colcor wheel"                ></p><p>As you can see, we have every color available in this wheel and they are arranged in a unison with the mixed colors starting with red, green and blue and working towards each other.</p><h2 id="Color-Harmony"><a href="#Color-Harmony" class="headerlink" title="Color Harmony"></a>Color Harmony</h2><p>So now we know how the wheel is made and what it looks like. What does it do? We can use this wheel now to gather our palette. Within color theory we talk about harmonious colors that work together in a pleasant way creating less stress on the eyes to find information in your scene.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-harmony.jpg"                      alt="color harmony"                ></p><p>One such harmony is complementary colors and luckily for us this is very easy to find. You take your base color and find the opposite color on the wheel. In this example the complementary color to blue is yellow depicted with a red line.</p><p>These colors always work as they create contrast and stability.</p><p>The blue lines represent what is known as split contrasting colors and these will create balance with each other.</p><p>The corners of the black rectangle land on what is known as tetradic complement and allows you to add four colors with the understanding that they will complement each other perfectly. Lastly is the purple line which represents the analogous complementary colors, you can pick these neighboring colors with the peace of mind that they will harmonize with each other. There are many more but these four are the main ones that you will use more often than any other, by selecting colors using these four main types you can create a palette for your scenes and allow the viewer to effortlessly enjoy your content. These types work no matter where you start from on the wheel so long as you keep the distances the same.</p><h2 id="But-How-Do-I-Use-This"><a href="#But-How-Do-I-Use-This" class="headerlink" title="But How Do I Use This"></a>But How Do I Use This</h2><p>You may still be unsure as to how to implement color theory into your videos. Let’s look at some scenarios that color theory may help your creations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-color-theory-video.jpg"                      alt="apply color theory video"                ></p><p>In this scene the director decided that the backdrop should complement the top the actor is wearing, looking at our wheel we can see the complementary color would be dark purple so they started with that, to create a more dynamic scene they then used the analogous colors of that purple being pink and red and created the backdrop. This creates a harmony within the scene and makes it effortless to see all the key elements straight away.</p><p>As you can see from this example the base color for the scene is a dark blue&#x2F;purple and using the analogous color of pink they created a point of interest within the scene that doesn’t look out of place. This is a very good way to pull the viewers eyes towards something you want them to take in above all else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/movie-cover-with-color-theory.jpg"                      alt="movie cover with color theory"                ></p><p>As you can see from all the movie covers above, they all use complementary colors from the blues to the war yellows and oranges, this creates high contrast and balance and is something done within the movie industry in every scene. It’s no coincidence that the joker is purple and green or that the iron man is red and gold, this is well prepared and researched in the planning stages of everything a visual artist creates.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>By including this into your thought process when creating videos with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will achieve well balanced and harmonious content for your viewer to enjoy and create better engagement. It’s not by chance these things happen though, it’s through research and planning that the most iconic scenes and characters are created and this is just one small brick in the foundations of content creation. With practice this will become second nature to you and that is the main goal of this guide.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Harmonious-Habits-to-Develop-While-Taking-in-Your-Favorite-Episodes"><a href="#Harmonious-Habits-to-Develop-While-Taking-in-Your-Favorite-Episodes" class="headerlink" title="Harmonious Habits to Develop While Taking in Your Favorite Episodes"></a>Harmonious Habits to Develop While Taking in Your Favorite Episodes</h2><p>Using podcasts to learn and entertain is a great idea. Multitasking is also possible, which is convenient for people with little free time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast live"                ></p><p>So, to make the most of your time spent listening to podcasts, here are some ideas on what you can do while listening! Keep reading to find out more.</p><h2 id="When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do"><a href="#When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do" class="headerlink" title="When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?"></a>When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?</h2><p>You do not need to dedicate a specific time to listen to podcasts. The entire idea of the podcast is auto-based information and shows to entertain users while doing something tedious and tiresome.</p><p>It allows you to fill those moments by learning new things and improving cognitive skills. Plus, it is a side-effect of doing things like driving, walking the dog, and commuting to work. Basically, all these tasks should meet all these or one of these criteria:</p><h3 id="●-No-need-to-use-your-brain"><a href="#●-No-need-to-use-your-brain" class="headerlink" title="● No need to use your brain"></a>● No need to use your brain</h3><p>Tasks like commuting, taking a bath, or doing dishes are subconscious. Yes, you can make them mindful and also make their meditative process. But if you are still bored, it is best to fill these little moments of your day with information-rich podcasts. Any mindless task is an opportunity. You do not need to devote any attention to these tasks and can listen to podcasts during this time.</p><h3 id="●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently"><a href="#●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently" class="headerlink" title="● Thing is able to do independently"></a>● Thing is able to do independently</h3><p>Collaborative work involves communicating with others. So, it is usually best to listen to the podcast when doing something independently. But this does not mean you should always listen to the podcast when doing independent work only. Even if you are surrounded by others and working on something independently, then you can fill the time with the podcast.</p><p>Moreover, some things like when you are driving with someone or you are on a road trip, and the other person also enjoys listening to the podcast, then you can fill the time with podcast episodes that interest you both. This also allows you to talk about the episodes and the ideas discussed there, and you both will have something to talk about.</p><h3 id="●-Repetitive"><a href="#●-Repetitive" class="headerlink" title="● Repetitive"></a>● Repetitive</h3><p>You can tune in to the podcasts for repetitive tasks like doing the dishes, gardening, etc. The idea is to complement the repetitive task with something useful.</p><h2 id="15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts"><a href="#15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts"></a>15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts</h2><p>That said, here’s a short list of things to do while listening to a podcast. It is important to note that not all of you might be doing these tasks, but you must be doing something along these lines. So, it is all about familiarizing you with mindless tasks and how you can make the most of that activity by complementing it with a podcast episode.</p><h3 id="1-Yoga-or-stretch"><a href="#1-Yoga-or-stretch" class="headerlink" title="1. Yoga or stretch"></a>1. Yoga or stretch</h3><p>As surprising as this might sound, listening to a podcast during Yoga or stretch is a great way to spice things up. Although most folks might prefer to combine yoga or gym with music, you can still listen to an information-packed yoga Podcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-2.jpg"                      alt="yoga podcast"                ></p><p>Besides, once you learn the stretch or yoga positions, it becomes a subconscious process. So, chances are, you might not need music to do the stretches or exercises you’ve already learned. Overall, a good yoga podcast will help improve your knowledge of the yoga field!</p><h3 id="2-Jogging"><a href="#2-Jogging" class="headerlink" title="2. Jogging"></a>2. Jogging</h3><p>Jogging appeals for its mindlessness is prominent among people. Just one foot in front of the other is all jogging and running demands. Again, most people listen to music while on a jog or run. However, you can switch from music to your favorite podcasts easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-3.jpg"                      alt="jogging podcast"                ></p><p>Listening to podcasts is a mindful activity, so when you run or jog with a podcast episode playing in your ears, it is easy to get distracted. So, it is vital to jog or run in a safe environment while listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="3-Fishing"><a href="#3-Fishing" class="headerlink" title="3. Fishing"></a>3. Fishing</h3><p>Many people think about an activity that involves catching fish. However, catching fish is just part of fishing. In reality, it is the moments you share with your family, see new things, and experience new challenges, and that is what fishing is all about.</p><p>If you go fishing often and listen to music or sit with your friends, you can instead listen to a podcast episode this time and create a different experience for everyone in the group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-4.jpg"                      alt="fishing podcast"                ></p><p>Moreover, listening to a podcast while fishing does not mean you should start the podcast only when you sit near the lake or pond to fish. It is the entire process; you can start your podcast episodes right from when you take your car, the breaks you take, and while returning too. Try this one when you go fishing and dedicate all the time you set for fishing to listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="4-Organize-your-photos-or-files"><a href="#4-Organize-your-photos-or-files" class="headerlink" title="4. Organize your photos or files"></a>4. Organize your photos or files</h3><p>If you often take time to organize your photos or files, you can combine that process with listening to your favorite podcasts. As mentioned, listening to a podcast is about concentrating on it and understanding the ideas discussed. So, you can do that with any mindless activities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-5.jpg"                      alt="organizing podcast"                ></p><p>The benefit of combining listening to a podcast while organizing your photos or files is that you can learn new things and simplify your life by organizing your folders filled with countless images and files you always want to manage. It is to be noted that you can also listen to podcast episodes while managing your mail, scrolling through social media pages, or editing photos.</p><h3 id="5-Cook-a-meal"><a href="#5-Cook-a-meal" class="headerlink" title="5.

Any mindless task is an opportunity.

So, it is usually best to listen to the podcast when doing something independently. But this does not mean you should always listen to the podcast when doing independent work only. Even if you are surrounded by others and working on something independently, then you can fill the time with the podcast.</p><p>Moreover, some things like when you are driving with someone or you are on a road trip, and the other person also enjoys listening to the podcast, then you can fill the time with podcast episodes that interest you both.

Yoga or stretch"></a>1. Yoga or stretch</h3><p>As surprising as this might sound, listening to a podcast during Yoga or stretch is a great way to spice things up.

Try this one when you go fishing and dedicate all the time you set for fishing to listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="4-Organize-your-photos-or-files-1"><a href="#4-Organize-your-photos-or-files-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

Take a bath</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-11.jpg"                      alt="taking a bath podcast"                ></p><p>Many people take baths for granted. It is one of the best ways to reset, relax, and recharge yourself after a tiresome day. You should always make your bathes meditative or go really far into a spiritual process.</p><p>Try this: set the right temperature of the water, add essential oils to the bathtub, light some candles, and play your favorite podcast. Believe me, soon, taking a bath while listening to a podcast will become one of the best moments of your day.</p><h3 id="13-Commute-1"><a href="#13-Commute-1" class="headerlink" title="13. Commute"></a>13. Commute</h3><p>Daily commutes occupy a large part of everyone’s day. Yes, the work from home is becoming a reality. But that reality is still far in the future. Until then, you have to commute to work, children to school, groceries, and so on. Well, you can fill these times with information-rich podcasts and learn new things.</p><p>It sounds like you might not focus and listen to the podcast like you would at home. But you’ll be amazed at how well you can adapt podcast listening while commuting in a bus or train filled with people.</p><h3 id="14-Clean-the-house-1"><a href="#14-Clean-the-house-1" class="headerlink" title="14. Clean the house"></a>14. Clean the house</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-12.jpg"                      alt="clean the house podcast"                ></p><p>Again, it all comes down to making a daunting task like cleaning the house fun and entertaining. If you truly enjoy listening to the podcast, play it on your home theatre and listen to the episodes as you clean your house.</p><p>Most people ignore these beautiful tasks of the day, thinking they will be wasting their time, and often hire a housemaid. But that’s the beauty of the modern world; you can make these tasks fun and entertaining if only complemented with the right podcasts or music.</p><h3 id="15-Haircut-or-hair-dye-1"><a href="#15-Haircut-or-hair-dye-1" class="headerlink" title="15. Haircut or hair dye"></a>15. Haircut or hair dye</h3><p>A haircut is a time that you give to your barber. It is all about sitting on the chair and letting the masters do their work. And putting on earphones for listening to music and podcast can be disastrous, as one snip and your costly earphones will be gone for good.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-13.jpg"                      alt="haircut podcast"                ></p><p>However, you can make the time of everyone sitting at the saloon beautiful by simply asking the barber to play one of the podcasts they like or you like. This will also allow you to experience new podcasts you aren’t familiar with and initiate a good conversation with your client.</p><h2 id="Summing-up-1"><a href="#Summing-up-1" class="headerlink" title="Summing up"></a>Summing up</h2><p>The above list of things to do while listening to podcasts is all about acquainting you with tedious tasks and making them beautiful.</p><p>As mentioned, you can complement a podcast episode with any boring task you have to do daily and make your time most effective and fun.</p><p>Overall, there are too many mindless things that you have to do daily; simply remember to carry your earphones and make that mindless activity into a beautiful, fun, and informative session.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"

What Kind of Music Can You Use for the Podcast Intro?"></a>Part 1. What Kind of Music Can You Use for the Podcast Intro?</h2><p>Various types of music can be used for podcast intros, including creative common music, royalty-free music, and public domain music. So, whether you’re looking to use vocals or special music as an intro for your podcast show, it’s crucial you understand these different types of music, as it’ll save you from violating copyright laws that could compromise your podcast show’s reputation online.</p><p><strong>Creative Common Music (Free to use)</strong></p><p>Creative Common Music is music tracks where the artist gives users 100% freedom to use it without permission. It’s a type of music with no copyright. But you might be required to provide credit to the artist. So please read the terms and conditions attached to any creative common music before using it.</p><p><strong>Royalty-Free Music (Paid)</strong></p><p>Royalty-Free Music is the opposite of Creative Common Music. To use such music, you need to have a subscription on the website or make a one-time payment to have 100% right to use it in your podcast intro. In addition, such music is usually subjected to copyright. So, using it without permission will risk your podcast show’s reputation.</p><p><strong>Public Domain Music (Free to use)</strong></p><p>Public Domain Music is music with an expired copyright license published in a public domain where you can use them for free without permission or giving credit. For example, in the United States, music works published in 1926 or earlier are Public Domain Music.</p><h2 id="Part-2-10-Places-To-Get-Music-for-Your-Podcast-Intros"><a href="#Part-2-10-Places-To-Get-Music-for-Your-Podcast-Intros" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 10 Places To Get Music for Your Podcast Intros"></a>Part 2. 10 Places To Get Music for Your Podcast Intros</h2><p>A professional-sounding podcast starts with intro music and uses songs to move the story forward.

In other words, understand what is considered legal and illegal or illegitimate use.</p><p>Retain that even using non-copyrighted music can sometimes land you in legal trouble, so it is better to know how to avoid it when using non-copyrighted or copyrighted music. Here are the factors that you should always consider when choosing to include any piece in your podcast:</p><ul><li><strong>Always get permission in writing and transfer or license.</strong> Even when you are using royalty-free music for podcast intros, ensure to have some written proof that you’ve received permission to use the track in your podcast.</li><li><strong>Ensure that the transfer license or written permission covers the publisher and creators’ names to avoid legal troubles.</strong> Usually, royalty-free music providers bundle all these details together, so you are fine.

What Kind of Music Can You Use for the Podcast Intro?</p><p>Various types of music can be used for podcast intros, including creative common music, royalty-free music, and public domain music. So, whether you’re looking to use vocals or special music as an intro for your podcast show, it’s crucial you understand these different types of music, as it’ll save you from violating copyright laws that could compromise your podcast show’s reputation online.</p><p><strong>Creative Common Music (Free to use)</strong></p><p>Creative Common Music is music tracks where the artist gives users 100% freedom to use it without permission.

On the contrary, you can get music for podcast intros even for free without crediting the musician. However, it is essential to understand how to avoid legal troubles. In other words, understand what is considered legal and illegal or illegitimate use.</p><p>Retain that even using non-copyrighted music can sometimes land you in legal trouble, so it is better to know how to avoid it when using non-copyrighted or copyrighted music. Here are the factors that you should always consider when choosing to include any piece in your podcast:</p><ul><li><strong>Always get permission in writing and transfer or license.</strong> Even when you are using royalty-free music for podcast intros, ensure to have some written proof that you’ve received permission to use the track in your podcast.</li><li><strong>Ensure that the transfer license or written permission covers the publisher and creators’ names to avoid legal troubles.</strong> Usually, royalty-free music providers bundle all these details together, so you are fine. Still, ensure that the transfer license includes this information.</li><li><strong>If your podcast plays worldwide, you will need permission from the authors to use the music in all countries.</strong> Otherwise, the use of music can be subjected to perpetuity. That is, you might have permission to use the music tracks in some parts of the world but not the entire world. So, ensure to take permission to use the music track worldwide.</li><li><strong>Don’t use a music track multiple times, even if you have received permission to use it only once.</strong> These distinctions are crucial to specify.</li><li><strong>Remember the terms and conditions mentioned on the royalty-free music distribution services.</strong> For instance, some Creative Commons licenses come with the situation that you must credit the creator. In case you violate the rule, the music will be considered copyrighted.</li><li><strong>When you take music from a freelancer, or it is personally made for your podcast on a special request by you, ensure that the creator owns all the rights.</strong> In several cases, podcast creators have had to pay for the freelancer’s mistakes. You can sign a contract with the freelancer and ensure that it is composed initially, not copied from some other music.</li></ul><h2 id="Typical-Music-for-Podcast-Intro-Questions-Answered-1"><a href="#Typical-Music-for-Podcast-Intro-Questions-Answered-1" class="headerlink" title="Typical Music for Podcast Intro Questions, Answered"></a>Typical Music for Podcast Intro Questions, Answered</h2><h3 id="1-Is-it-OK-to-only-use-a-few-seconds-of-a-copyrighted-song-1"><a href="#1-Is-it-OK-to-only-use-a-few-seconds-of-a-copyrighted-song-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Is it OK to only use a few seconds of a copyrighted song?"></a>1. Is it OK to only use a few seconds of a copyrighted song?</h3><p>No. It will violate copyright laws, and your podcast might be under scrutiny for copyright infringement. Just retain that even a second of copyrighted music can get your podcast banned, or you may get fined by the creator. When using music in professional environments, it is better to avoid copyrighted music created by professionals.</p><h3 id="2-What-happens-if-I-receive-a-copyright-infringement-notice-1"><a href="#2-What-happens-if-I-receive-a-copyright-infringement-notice-1" class="headerlink" title="2. What happens if I receive a copyright infringement notice?"></a>2. What happens if I receive a copyright infringement notice?</h3><p>Copyright infringement notices are given to bring it to your attention that you’re using someone else’s music. Such notices are the best way to handle copyright infringement as the matter can be settled outside the court, usually with fines.</p><p>So, avoiding using copyrighted music in your podcasts is best.</p><h3 id="3-Can-I-use-their-music-if-my-podcast-is-about-reviewing-songs-or-artists-1"><a href="#3-Can-I-use-their-music-if-my-podcast-is-about-reviewing-songs-or-artists-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Can I use their music if my podcast is about reviewing songs or artists?"></a>3. Can I use their music if my podcast is about reviewing songs or artists?</h3><p>Yes. If your podcast revolves around criticism, education, media, reporting, or researching, then using copyrighted materials comes into “fair use” practice. Nevertheless, it is better to ask permission from the creators beforehand, as judicial scrutiny can be against your favor.</p><p>There are four cycles in which copyrighted music will be evaluated as fair use. They are:</p><ul><li>The character and purpose of use of the copyrighted music.</li><li>The nature of copyrighted music and your work.</li><li>The amount and substantiality of the portion taken, i.e., whether it is genuine or not.</li><li>The effect of using copyrighted music in the potential market.</li></ul><p>Judges will evaluate the use of music based on these four principles step-by-step. If the use of copyright passes each step, it will be considered fair use. Otherwise, the use of music will be regarded as illegal, and you may get fined or imprisoned.</p><h2 id="Summing-up-1"><a href="#Summing-up-1" class="headerlink" title="Summing up"></a>Summing up</h2><p>The main aim of this guide was to inform you about the sites that have royalty-free music for podcast intros so that you can use music in your podcast intros without legal problems.</p><p>The problem is that many podcast creators are unaware that they cannot use copyrighted music. And this often results in a ban on the podcast or huge fines.</p><p>However, you now have all the information regarding how and where to use music for podcast intros. Always use only non-copyrighted music so you do not face such problems.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

Sony has also made an announcement of a new iteration of PS4 which will support VR gaming and it will be released on 13th October this year.</p><p> The market experts believe that the participation of these technology giants in the VR gaming industry will increase the sales and take the market towards maturity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-market.jpg"                      alt=" vr-market"                ></p><h2 id="What-the-VR-hardware-market-will-be-in-future-3"><a href="#What-the-VR-hardware-market-will-be-in-future-3" class="headerlink" title="What the VR hardware market will be in future"></a>What the VR hardware market will be in future</h2><p> The prospect of the VR gaming market in the three years is expected to boom literally.

The number will hit the million marks as expected.</p><p> This is too early for a technological revolution to take place and there is nothing to be so frustrated at this early age. It needs time and with the increasing awareness the sales will boom. All the companies need to focus at the promotion of this new technology now. They should let the users know how their gaming experience is about to change. In the near future VR Gear is going to be the next big thing in technology.</p><h2 id="Brief-overview-of-VR-hardware-3"><a href="#Brief-overview-of-VR-hardware-3" class="headerlink" title="Brief overview of VR hardware"></a>Brief overview of VR hardware</h2><p> If the opinions of the experts are to be believed, we are still quite far from the mature virtual reality market.
