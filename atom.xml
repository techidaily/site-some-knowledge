The better your channel is optimized for search and the more engaging content you have, the more likely your videos will be discovered by people who can share them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/increase-views-on-youtube.jpg"                      alt="increase views on youtube"                ></p><h2 id="1-Pick-a-specific-subject-matter-or-topic"><a href="#1-Pick-a-specific-subject-matter-or-topic" class="headerlink" title="#1.

Don’t worry about producing the highest quality video"></a>#2. Don’t worry about producing the highest quality video</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-high-quality-video.jpg"                      alt="shoot high quality video"                ></p><p>Don’t worry about producing the highest quality video. As long as you have a relevant and interesting topic, you can always improve the quality of your videos over time with more resources and equipment. Focus on creating content that is highly valuable to your audience and provides them with something they haven’t seen before—not how pretty it looks.</p><h2 id="3-Post-in-related-video-communities-to-find-an-audience"><a href="#3-Post-in-related-video-communities-to-find-an-audience" class="headerlink" title="#3. Post in related video communities to find an audience"></a>#3. Post in related video communities to find an audience</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/post-video-to-community.jpg"                      alt="post video to community"                ></p><p>Once you’ve finished your video and uploaded it to YouTube, the next step is to post in related video communities. You can find these by searching for keywords related to your video or its topic, searching for the title of your own video (assuming that it’s not too long), or doing a simple search on Google.</p><p>Once you find a relevant community, make sure that you’re posting in the right place! Some communities may be specific about what kind of content they allow—for example, if someone makes a “How To” video about how to make an omelette, she probably shouldn’t post it in “Gaming.” Be sure that you’re posting in the right category.</p><h2 id="4-Write-keyword-rich-titles-and-descriptions"><a href="#4-Write-keyword-rich-titles-and-descriptions" class="headerlink" title="#4. Write keyword-rich titles and descriptions"></a>#4. Write keyword-rich titles and descriptions</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/use-seo-skill-in-youtube-video.jpg"                      alt="use seo skill in youtube video"                ></p><p>The first step to getting more views is writing keyword-rich titles and descriptions. Keywords are important for search engines, which means they’re also important for your video’s ranking on YouTube. You want your videos to appear in the “top” (highest-ranked) results when someone searches for a certain topic or phrase.</p><p>A good way to get ranked high is by using keywords. Keywords will help you rank higher in YouTube searches, which means more people will see your video!</p><h2 id="5-Use-annotations-to-link-videos-together"><a href="#5-Use-annotations-to-link-videos-together" class="headerlink" title="#5. Use annotations to link videos together"></a>#5. Use annotations to link videos together</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/use-animation-to-link-videos.jpg"                      alt="use animation to link videos"                ></p><p>Annotations are a great way to link videos together, or to link videos on your channel with other videos and resources. Here are some examples of things you can do with annotations:</p><ul><li>Link multiple channels together.</li><li>Link YouTube videos from other channels.</li><li>Link external sites that are relevant to your content (e.g., links to related blogs).</li><li>Add additional resources for more information about the topic at hand (the most common example is using a URL shortener like bitly).</li></ul><h2 id="6-Comment-back-on-other-people’s-videos-in-your-niche"><a href="#6-Comment-back-on-other-people’s-videos-in-your-niche" class="headerlink" title="#6. Comment back on other people’s videos in your niche"></a>#6. Comment back on other people’s videos in your niche</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/comment-other-videos-in-your-niche.jpg"                      alt="comment other videos in your niche"                ></p><p>Another way to get more views is by commenting on other people’s videos. You should do this only if the video is in your niche and the channel has a lot of subscribers (over 1,000). When you comment, make sure that you engage with the creator and add value to the conversation. If they ask a question, answer it! If they want feedback, give them some! If they ask for help with something, offer advice or information. And if someone comments on one of your videos asking for help with something related to what you’re talking about in your video—don’t ignore them! Reply back right away so that people see that interaction on their newsfeeds and find out more about what you have to say about it.</p><p>This might seem like an obvious way to get more views but I’ve seen many creators who don’t interact much with other channels because they think their audience won’t care about what other people are doing or saying online. But getting involved in conversations with other creators in your niche will attract new viewers because:</p><ul><li>It shows that there’s a level of trust between creators working together within communities; this makes viewers feel like there’s an opportunity for collaboration as well (and hopefully future collaborations!).</li></ul><h2 id="7-Upload-at-least-one-video-per-week-and-never-skip-a-week"><a href="#7-Upload-at-least-one-video-per-week-and-never-skip-a-week" class="headerlink" title="#7. Upload at least one video per week and never skip a week"></a>#7. Upload at least one video per week and never skip a week</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/upload-video-to-youtube-regularly.jpg"                      alt="upload video to youtube regularly"                ></p><p>To keep your audience coming back for more, upload at least one video per week and never skip a week. If you have trouble uploading that often, try to upload a video every two weeks or so. If that’s not feasible, at least make sure you have one ready to go before the end of the month so you can post it before the next month begins.</p><p>To make sure that videos get uploaded regularly without hassle, put them on a schedule (e.g., Monday through Friday). This way, you know when each new video will come out so there’s no stress about missing the deadline for getting it online in time for its scheduled release date.</p><p>The best way to ensure regularity is by setting up an automated scheduler with analytics services like Tubebuddy that will automatically publish your content while also keeping track of when each new episode goes live on YouTube and how many views each receives over time—helping predict what kind of clip is likely to be most popular among viewers based on past trends</p><h2 id="8-Add-calls-to-action-at-the-beginning-of-your-video"><a href="#8-Add-calls-to-action-at-the-beginning-of-your-video" class="headerlink" title="#8.

This is a great way to increase traffic, especially if you have a small audience right now.</li><li>Encourage viewers to visit your website, or any other product or service that you offer as part of your channel’s brand (if applicable).</li></ul><h2 id="9-Fill-your-channel-with-useful-information-not-just-marketing-messages"><a href="#9-Fill-your-channel-with-useful-information-not-just-marketing-messages" class="headerlink" title="#9.

While this may be important for those who are looking to sell a product or service—and these types of things should definitely be mentioned at some point in your video—the majority of your viewers are not going to want to hear about how great you are.</p><p>If you want to grow an audience on YouTube and get more views, then one thing you need to do is provide value. This could mean sharing tips and tricks, answering questions from viewers or promoting other channels that produce great content related to your niche (which will encourage them share it with their friends).</p><h2 id="10-Use-playlists-effectively-to-get-more-views"><a href="#10-Use-playlists-effectively-to-get-more-views" class="headerlink" title="#10.

Use playlists effectively to get more views</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/create-playlist-for-youtube-videos.jpg"                      alt="create playlist for youtube videos"                ></p><p>Playlists are a great way to get more views for your YouTube videos. They allow you to group together related videos, making it easier for viewers to find what they’re looking for and watch more of your content. They also help in the search engine optimization (SEO) of those videos!</p><p>If you’re looking to create a series of videos, playlists are an ideal way to do so. You could create one playlist with all the episodes of your new show, or have separate playlists for each episode so people can binge-watch them all at once if they want to.</p><p>Playlists can also be used as a place where viewers can watch related content that isn’t necessarily part of another video—for example if someone just really likes one thing from one video but would like other similar things too (like say music from several artists).</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>We hope this post has helped you get more views for your YouTube videos! If you follow these steps, we promise that your channel will be full of high-quality content in no time. Remember to take it slow and don’t try to do everything at once. The most important thing is to stick with it - if you keep uploading videos every week and posting comments back on other people’s channels (and interacting with commenters), then an audience will come along eventually.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/fine-tuning-frames-a-comprehensible-approach-to-iphone-editing-for-2024/"><u>Fine-Tuning Frames  A Comprehensible Approach to iPhone Editing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-expert-guide-to-sierras-cloud-documentation-and-drive-integration/"><u>[New] Expert Guide to Sierra's Cloud Documentation & Drive Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-hololens-analysis-a-3d-interface-revolution-by-microsoft/"><u>In 2024, HoloLens Analysis  A 3D Interface Revolution by Microsoft</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-pursuit-of-perfection-is-black-gopro-better-than-sony-action-cam/"><u>[New] In Pursuit of Perfection  Is Black GoPro Better than Sony Action Cam?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-explore-top-church-platforms-for-global-audience/"><u>[Updated] Explore Top Church Platforms for Global Audience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-harmonious-hush-techniques-for-quieting-tunes/"><u>[New] Harmonious Hush  Techniques for QUIETing Tunes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-extract-audio-from-tweets-and-save-as-mp3s/"><u>In 2024, How to Extract Audio From Tweets and Save as MP3s</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expanding-photography-quality/"><u>2024 Approved  Expanding Photography Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-streamline-your-gameplay-professional-ps4-recording-tips/"><u>[New] In 2024, Streamline Your Gameplay  Professional PS4 Recording Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-desktop-capture-the-windows-user-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] Desktop Capture  The Windows User Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-iconic-discussions-in-history-top-10-on-reddit/"><u>In 2024, Iconic Discussions in History - Top 10 on Reddit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/10-best-online-destinations-for-accessible-images/"><u>10 Best Online Destinations for Accessible Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/snapspectacular-high-quality-windowsmac-screenshots-for-2024/"><u>SnapSpectacular  High-Quality Windows/Mac Screenshots for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-screencaptureelite-the-5-star-apeaksoft-evaluation/"><u>2024 Approved  ScreenCaptureElite – The 5-Star Apeaksoft Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-crystalclear-screenshot-on-w10/"><u>[New] In 2024, CrystalClear Screenshot on W10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/sending-your-creativity-soaring-pc-and-mac-tiktok-video-posts/"><u>Sending Your Creativity Soaring  PC & Mac TikTok Video Posts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-crafting-professional-gamers-content-with-obs-recordings/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Crafting Professional Gamers' Content with OBS Recordings</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

As we all know, the first thing a viewer sees when entering a live stream is the background. Therefore, picking a suitable background for these is extremely important.</p><p>Moreover, an attractive and suitable background also helps you to make your live stream environment the best. So now the question that may arise in your mind is how you guys choose the <strong>best background for your live stream</strong> and make their environment outstanding. Let us answer this question sincerely in the following.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Freepik</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Pngtree</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Movietools.info</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">Pixabay</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">XSplit VCam</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Bonus Tips: How to create your own animated live stream background?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">FAQs about Live Stream Backgrounds</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-I-4-tips-to-help-you-choose-a-live-streaming-background"><a href="#Part-I-4-tips-to-help-you-choose-a-live-streaming-background" class="headerlink" title="Part I. 4 tips to help you choose a live-streaming background"></a>Part I. 4 tips to help you choose a live-streaming background</h2><h3 id="1-Pure-color-background"><a href="#1-Pure-color-background" class="headerlink" title="1. Pure color background"></a>1. Pure color background</h3><p>You can choose any clean and solid color wall, curtain, or wallpaper as a background for your live stream. But make sure that it is neat enough and has a broad field of vision. Moreover, there is no exposure to it.</p><p>It will be best to choose one that can easily match any color. But remember, do not use pure white backgrounds as they are too reflective, which is not suitable for the vision of your stream as it affects the highlight of the streamer and the products very much.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-backgrounds-for-live-streaming-1.jpg"                      alt="pure color background"                ></p><h3 id="2-Neatly-organized-shelves"><a href="#2-Neatly-organized-shelves" class="headerlink" title="2.

It is a video-sharing platform where people share videos doing different activities. Due to the rise of cyberbullying, racism, and other harmful activities, concerns have been raised for minors using TikTok. In a bid to counter it, TikTok has banned kids under 13 from using the app.</p><p>The accounts of teens from 13 to 16 have been made private to minimize the negative effects. If you, by mistake, have entered the wrong birthdate when setting up your account, you can learn <strong>how to change your age on TikTok</strong> from this article.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="change age on tiktok featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Change-Your-Age-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Change-Your-Age-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Change Your Age on TikTok"></a>Part 1: How to Change Your Age on TikTok</h2><p>The 13-year age restriction on TikTok is not only to protect minors from the harmful side of the internet. It is to comply with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States. To ensure that users don’t cheat with age-requirement, TikTok has removed the option to edit the birthdate from the app.</p><p>It has also made all the accounts of those under 16 privates. If your account has been age-restricted by mistake, below are two possible methods on <strong>how</strong> <strong>to edit age on TikTok</strong>.</p><h3 id="Way-1-Contact-TikTok-Support-Team-to-Change-Your-Age-Recommended"><a href="#Way-1-Contact-TikTok-Support-Team-to-Change-Your-Age-Recommended" class="headerlink" title="Way 1: Contact TikTok Support Team to Change Your Age (Recommended)"></a>Way 1: Contact TikTok Support Team to Change Your Age (Recommended)</h3><p>Since TikTok has removed the feature to edit your birthdate from its app, you will need to contact their support team to change your age. You can contact support through the app if your account is still working. Otherwise, you will need to contact them through email. Below are the steps to contact support for changing your age through the TikTok app on your smartphone:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your TikTok app and tap on “Profile” from the bottom right corner. Next, touch on “Three Lines” from the top right corner of the profile screen and access “Settings and Privacy.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="select settings and privacy"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now navigate to the “Support &amp; About” section and tap “Report a Problem.” Press “Account and Profile” on the next screen and tap “Editing Profile.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="select report a problem option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Here, choose “Other,” and on the next window, press “Need More Help?” It will open a feedback form where you can mention your problem and request the support team to solve it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-4.jpg"                      alt="tap on need more help"                ></p><h3 id="Way-2-Create-a-New-TikTok-Account-to-Change-Your-Age-Not-Recommended"><a href="#Way-2-Create-a-New-TikTok-Account-to-Change-Your-Age-Not-Recommended" class="headerlink" title="Way 2: Create a New TikTok Account to Change Your Age (Not-Recommended)"></a>Way 2: Create a New TikTok Account to Change Your Age (Not-Recommended)</h3><p>If your TikTok account has been placed under age restriction, you can create a new TikTok account with the correct age. However, it is not the recommended method, as you will lose all of your old account data and followers.</p><p>If you are underage, you should not try to create a new account with a false age. Lying about your age can result in legal difficulties for you if caught. You can create a new TikTok account on your smartphone using TikTok app through these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install the TikTok app through Google Play Store or App Store and open it. Agree to their terms and services and tap “Profile” from the bottom right corner to navigate to the signup page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-5.jpg"                      alt="access the profile tab"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you choose “Email or Phone,” you will need to provide your “Email” or “Phone” on the next screen. You will need to go through a verification CAPTCHA and, on the next screen, create a password for your account. Provide your correct birthdate and press “Next” to complete the account creation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-6.jpg"                      alt="confirm your birthdate"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can also use your Google, Facebook, Apple, or Twitter account to create your TikTok account. Pressing any of these will take you to the respective app for login verification. Provide the confirmation, and your TikTok account will be created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-7.jpg"                      alt="select social media to sign up"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-TikTok-Video-Editor-–-Filmora-for-Mobile"><a href="#Part-2-TikTok-Video-Editor-–-Filmora-for-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: TikTok Video Editor – Filmora for Mobile"></a>Part 2: TikTok Video Editor – Filmora for Mobile</h2><p>Are you an avid TikTok user who likes creating fun and stunning videos to share with your followers?

Just a single uncontrollable blast of that windy shake can immediately cause a big disturbance in your video footage. If you are a drone lover and often use to record videos in air then it is good to buy Gimbals for your device. They can stabilize your camera during all sudden and planned movements without affecting your image quality.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10 must-have drone accessories &amp; parts &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> A gimbal is specially designed mechanism with rings; it pivots on right angles same as a chronometer or compass so that your attached device can stay perfectly aligned in horizontal direction even when aircraft is moving at high speed. Considering all sudden flight movements, the gimbal action is always safe and will keep things well aligned.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to remove jello effect from aerial video &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Types-of-Gimbal"><a href="#Types-of-Gimbal" class="headerlink" title="Types of Gimbal"></a>Types of Gimbal</h2><p> When you are about to invest on a new gimbal then it is necessary to go through several aspects for right selection. Firstly, the type of motor your gimbal is going to use is extremely important. The drone camera gimbals are usually available in different models and each one of these has unique features. So, if you are thinking to buy a new one then go into following details:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Type of Gimbal</th><th>Axis</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Servo Gimbal</td><td>&#x2F;</td><td>Light in weight and available with low price range</td><td>Their response time is a big issue</td></tr><tr><td>&#x2F;</td><td>Users need not to spend on additional controller board to operate it.</td><td>Most of users stay unsatisfied with its quality.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Brushless Gimbal</td><td>2 axis</td><td>Low price and Light weight</td><td>2 axis gimbals are able to stabilize only on roll and pitch axis</td></tr><tr><td>&#x2F;</td><td>You will have to compromise for quality</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&#x2F;</td><td>Its horizontal movements are found quite jittery</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3 axis</td><td>Due to presence of yaw it leads to higher stability, quality, pitch as well as roll to stabilize.</td><td>You will find it much heavier; it can affect your flight time.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>There are two radio transmitters: one can control camera and other works for pilot</td><td>You need to spend more.</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="What-to-Look-for-a-Camera-Gimbal-for-Drones"><a href="#What-to-Look-for-a-Camera-Gimbal-for-Drones" class="headerlink" title="What to Look for a Camera Gimbal for Drones"></a>What to Look for a Camera Gimbal for Drones</h2><h4 id="1-Price"><a href="#1-Price" class="headerlink" title="1. Price"></a>1. Price</h4><p> If you have fewer budgets then you need to plan more wisely for selection of gimbal. Most of the users prefer to buy servo gimbals in such situations as they are least expensive. Although, you may find little disturbance in your video footage but it can definitely meet your basic need for first person view. In case if you have enough savings then professionals suggest to go for brushless gimbals.</p><h4 id="2-Flight-Time"><a href="#2-Flight-Time" class="headerlink" title="2. Flight Time"></a>2. Flight Time</h4><p> Gimbals are going to add some weight to your drone hence they have direct impact on your flight time. Heavy gimbal means lesser flight time so you need to choose accordingly. A 2 axis type gimbal will force you to compromise for quality but it will allow your device to stay in air for longer duration. On the other side, 3 axis gimbals will provide you videos without any unwanted noise but yes they will reduce flight time.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Dones with Longest Flight Time for 2017 &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-Picture-Quality"><a href="#3-Picture-Quality" class="headerlink" title="3. Picture Quality"></a>3. Picture Quality</h4><p> Here is the most important factor that you need to consider while purchasing your new gimbal. If you are more focused about quality and clarity in footage then brushless gimbals are best option for you. But note that, it poses restriction on many other factors like price and the power consumption.</p><h4 id="4-Camera-Support"><a href="#4-Camera-Support" class="headerlink" title="4. Camera Support"></a>4. Camera Support</h4><p> Gimbals are developed with classic mechanism and they are able to work with dedicated camera units. You can also find gimbals that can handle multiple camera types. During your selection, prefer to pick a gimbal that can support GoPro cameras because they are most commonly used ones. GoPro cameras are highly recommended for aerial videography and photography so if you are also working in the same direction then prefer to choose your design accordingly.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Drones for GoPro in 2017 &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Pre-Calibration"><a href="#5-Pre-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="5. Pre-Calibration"></a>5. Pre-Calibration</h4><p> Gimbal calibration can be little complication job, especially if you are a beginner. The best option is to buy a gimbal that comes with pre-calibration and users simply need to plugin them and send their drone into air to get best results. If your gimbal demands calibration from your side then it is necessary to follow professional guidelines before sending your drone into air.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> Once you have selected your gimbal then you may find some difficulty in installation process.

At just under $450 on Amazon, this 28-inch Ultra HD monitor gives gamers a top-notch visual experience, impressive calibration options and the ability to work with some of the more powerful graphic cards on the market.</p><p> Affordability was always a major sticking point for 4k UHD monitors. Like its peers, this ASUS product fills a gap in the market and provides a much-improved gaming experience to gamers on a budget. Its 3840 x 2160px resolution makes for a great widescreen view that’s perfect for the sweeping panoramic scenes and epic scales that make video gaming so much fun today.</p><h2 id="ASUS-MG28UQ-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#ASUS-MG28UQ-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="ASUS MG28UQ 4K Monitor Pros and Cons"></a>ASUS MG28UQ 4K Monitor Pros and Cons</h2><p> The ASUS MG28UQ monitor has many great features worth highlighting. For starters, it comes with a TN Liquid Crystal Display screen that boasts an excellent 1ms response rate. It gets even better. This monitor also has AMD FreeSync. At its peak refresh rate, it provides consistently tear-free visuals when paired with compatible graphics cards.</p><p> It also sports a sturdy, fully adjustable stand that can support the monitor in landscape or portrait mode. With its VESA mount, gamers who prefer to mount their monitors on a wall can do so comfortably. And where multiple monitors are needed, the ASUS MG28UQ has visual alignment cues (arrows) that help ensure images display correctly across all screens.</p><p> On the downside however, the quality of imagery on this monitor drops significantly when it’s viewed from side angles. There’s also diminished image contrast when screen brightness is set to maximum. These issues can affect gaming experience where multiple players and viewers are involved. That said, these problems are typical for TN LCD screens which on the upside, have the fastest response rate of most LCD screens on the market today. That’s exactly why they’re perfect for gaming. Many gamers would agree that trading image quality at obscure angles for a synced, tear-free video experience is a fair compromise.</p><p> Another significant downside to this otherwise fantastic gaming monitor is its 60Hz peak refresh rate while in 4k UHD mode. The fact is that hardcore gaming increasingly requires a 144Hz refresh rate and gamers who play at this high refresh rate experience a significant drop in the quality of video gaming at lesser rates. While this 4k UHD monitor can perform at 144Hz theoretically, it’s unable to do so in reality due to the limited bandwidth of its input ports.</p><p> While this shortfall is significant, it is also true that the majority of average gamers use systems whose graphic cards can do no better than 60Hz. This means that for many average gamers, this monitor’s 60Hz limit is not a very serious problem.</p><h2 id="Hardware-Design"><a href="#Hardware-Design" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Design"></a>Hardware Design</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> The ASUS MG28UQ monitor has a sleek and unobtrusive design that’s somewhat different from what you get with flashier gaming monitors. It has even, wide bezels that frame its display without distracting from the screen. It also has a subtle black matte finish that’s bound to appeal to gamers who like minimalist design.</p><p> Its stand is a very critical component of this monitor’s functionality. It is designed to allow the screen to tilt outwards by up to 20 degrees, swivel right and left by 60 degrees, and pivot 90 degrees from landscape to portrait mode. Its 5.9-inch stand is also height adjustable. That’s a good deal of flexibility for a monitor that’s at the affordable end of the price spectrum.</p><p> The ASUS MG28UQ is also VESA compatible. This simply means that it has a standardized apparatus for mounting it safely on a wall. VESA compatibility guarantees that the mount is sufficient for the weight and size of the monitor. The importance of this feature cannot be overstated as inadequate wall mounts can prove very costly indeed.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Ports and Connectivity"></a>2. Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-ports.jpg"                      alt="asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-ports"                ></p><p> It’s hard to fault the ASUS MG28UQ 4K monitor for input connectivity since it features a total of 8 input ports. It includes one HDMI 2.0 port, two HDMI 1.4 ports, one DisplayPort 1.2, three USB 3.0 ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack. This monitor has enough connectivity options to support robust gaming data transfer as well as external media devices like a keyboard, mouse, camera and smartphone. Along with its AMD FreeSync technology, this monitor is built to support a fully-equipped game station for optimal gaming performance.</p><p> It’s also great that while the input panel is located at the lowest side of the monitor, it can easily be reached by pivoting the monitor towards portrait mode. Most non-pivot monitors that have theirs similarly placed can be a hassle to set up. To reach their input panels, gamers must bend themselves uncomfortably or worse, upset the balance of their monitors by tilting them dangerously outward. With its effective pivoting stand, the ASUS MG28UQ is quite easy to set up and use.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-OSD-and-Settings"><a href="#1-OSD-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1.OSD and Settings"></a>1.OSD and Settings</h4><p> This monitor’s On-Screen Menu is accessed through a 5-way joystick located at the back of the monitor. It comes with multiple picture presets such as Racing mode which happens to be its default picture setting.</p><p> In addition to the usual image adjustment menus like brightness, contrast and color temperature, the ASUS MG28UQ monitor also has easy-to-use control menus for its TraceFree and VividPixel technologies, designed to minimize ghosting and boost clarity. Its AMD FreeSync feature, which is active only for DisplayPort inputs, can also be adjusted through the OSD menu.</p><p> GamePlus Technology is a proprietary feature that can also be activated through the OSD. It lets gamers display timers, FPS counters and custom crosshairs for better aiming accuracy.</p><h4 id="2-Color-Performance"><a href="#2-Color-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.Color Performance"></a>2.Color Performance</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-color-accuracy.jpg"                      alt="asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-color-accuracy"                ></p><p> Eye strain is a problem most users experience after hours of non-stop gaming. It helps to have a monitor that can reduce eye strain and improve user comfort. The ASUS MG28UQ monitor is a great choice in this regard. It has an effective Glare Filter as well as Blue Light Reduction and Flicker-Free technologies that mean it can be used comfortably in daylight.</p><p> Despite its ease on the eyes, color management is one area where this monitor is found wanting. The ASUS MG28UQ monitor can display only 96 – 97% of the sRGB color gamut and under 80% of Adobe’s robust RGB gamut. This is significant because color accuracy is very important for professional visual designers who also tend to use 4K UHD monitors. This limitation with color display all but ensures that the ASUS MG28UQ monitor is best used exclusively for gaming. And as a gaming monitor, many would agree that its limited color display capacity is not a deal-breaker.</p><h4 id="3-Gaming-Performance"><a href="#3-Gaming-Performance" class="headerlink" title="3.Gaming Performance"></a>3.Gaming Performance</h4><p> To get the best out of any 4K UHD monitor, it’s absolutely important to have the right Graphics Card. The AMD FreeSync technology that ships with the ASUS MG28UQ monitor activates only when a compatible Graphics Card is detected. With the right GPU in place, FreeSync effectively reduces tearing and image stuttering, making this monitor by and large, a pleasure to use.</p><p> As mentioned above however, even with powerful GPUs, the maximum refresh rate possible on this 4K UHD monitor is 60Hz. In all fairness, this is due to the bandwidth limit on the input ports that ship with this monitor. DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 can easily support 144Hz refresh rates.</p><h4 id="5-Highlighted-Features"><a href="#5-Highlighted-Features" class="headerlink" title="5.Highlighted Features"></a>5.Highlighted Features</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-game-visual-settings.jpg"                      alt="asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-game-visual-settings"                ></p><p> ASUS claims their MG28HQ 4K monitor is “built for victory in the gaming arena”. With their exclusive GamePlus and GameVisual technologies, it’s hard to dispute their claim.</p><p> GamePlus lets users set on-screen timers and custom crosshairs that can significantly improve their gaming precision. The crosshairs or reticules can be activated even if the feature is not native to the video game in use. It’s a neat addition that’s sure to play well with most gamers.</p><p> GameVisual is a set of inbuilt presets designed to optimize users’ viewing experience. There’s a Racing mode, a Scenery mode, and an sRGB mode. GameVisual also has a Cinema Mode that’s perfect for watching 4K UHD movies and TV Shows. Its black level, cool hues and optimal saturation make for a great movie watching experience.</p><p> The ASUS MG28UQ 4K monitor also has inbuilt 2 watt speakers that support a 3.5mm headphone jack. While many testers agree they’re not sufficient for gaming purposes, it’s a feature that makes this monitor a solid entertainment device.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> In conclusion, the ASUS MG28UQ monitor is a fantastic gaming and entertainment monitor. It certainly provides excellent gaming performance for its affordable price range. Its fast response rate of 1ms and 4k refresh rate of 60Hz deliver tear-free and steady-streaming imagery for most video games.</p><p> This 4K monitor ships with an adjustable stand is a benefit that cannot be overstated. This feature affords many functional and ergonomic benefits that users will greatly appreciate. Its 8 input ports also make it an ideal centerpiece for a fully equipped gaming station.</p><p> The bottom line is that the ASUS MG28UQ 4K monitor delivers on its maker’s promise. With anticipated improvements to TN LCD screens and input port technologies, future iterations in this product line are likely to overcome the limited color rendering capacity and capped refresh rate of the ASUS MG28UQ 4K monitor.</p><hr><p> Recommend: Use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora scrn Screen Recorder Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to record your gaming and edit your gaming video easily.

The tips given here will be very simple and implementable. Moreover, these helpful tips can turn you into the best unboxing influencer in a limited time. So, let’s get into them without any further delay:</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Keep-Your-Videos-Short"><a href="#Tip-1-Keep-Your-Videos-Short" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Keep Your Videos Short"></a>Tip 1: Keep Your Videos Short</h3><p>Primarily, look at the basic factor of TikTok that actually attract a viewer. The first thing you should keep in mind while creating an unboxing video is to make it short. People who want to watch long videos can do that on YouTube, but the TikTok audience loves short videos. As you already know, TikTok allows you to create videos of 15 seconds, 60 seconds, 3 minutes, and 10 minutes.</p><p>However, the optimal recommended length for good and engaging TikTok’s 21 to 34 seconds. TikTok comprises hyper-specific algorithms which could detect if the viewer watched your video to the end or just passed it up. Thus, ensure you don’t make long <strong>unboxing TikTok</strong> videos, which will bore the viewers.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Use-the-Right-Hashtag-to-Reach-Your-Audience"><a href="#Tip-2-Use-the-Right-Hashtag-to-Reach-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Use the Right Hashtag to Reach Your Audience"></a>Tip 2: Use the Right Hashtag to Reach Your Audience</h3><p>One of the most common and effective ways to increase followers on any platform is to use the hashtag. No matter if you are working on <strong>kawaii unboxing TikTok</strong> or a technical one, always use the right hashtag. It is like you are taking part in the conversation on social media.</p><p>Furthermore, hashtags lead to high user engagement and promote your brand. Therefore, if you have no idea about picking hashtags related to your product, the table mentioned below will help you:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Hashtag</strong></th><th><strong>Total Views</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>#Unboxing</strong></td><td>2.9B</td></tr><tr><td><strong>#unboxingasmr</strong></td><td>585.8M</td></tr><tr><td><strong>#unboxingtoys</strong></td><td>427.6M</td></tr><tr><td><strong>#unboxingvideo</strong></td><td>362.8M</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Tip-3-Make-Your-Videos-Compatible-with-Small-Screen"><a href="#Tip-3-Make-Your-Videos-Compatible-with-Small-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Make Your Videos Compatible with Small Screen"></a>Tip 3: Make Your Videos Compatible with Small Screen</h3><p>No one watches TikTok on big screens. Before uploading a video, ensure it is compatible with a small screen. You can also shoot your video in both portrait and landscape mode, but 90% of people prefer to watch in portrait mode. Also, cross-check the <strong>unboxing TikTok</strong> resolution before posting it and make sure it’s 1080 x1920.</p><p>However, if the video’s resolution exceeds 1080p, don’t panic because TikTok will automatically minimize it. Other than this, keep the video at 9:16 for a better watching experience. As for the file size, it can vary with your device. For Android, it’s 72MB, and for Apple, it’s 287.6MB. The file types for unboxing videos TikTok support are MOV and MP4.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="create proper size tiktok videos"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Film-in-Well-Lit-Condition"><a href="#Tip-4-Film-in-Well-Lit-Condition" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Film in Well-Lit Condition"></a>Tip 4: Film in Well-Lit Condition</h3><p>It is evident that if your TikTok has no captivating and significant points, no one will watch it. Before shooting a video, ensure the environment is neat, clean, and tidy. Moreover, focus on the lighting of a room and try to use aesthetic lights that can cast delightful impressions on users. Play nice background music that can cast soothing effects on the users.</p><p>Create a theme color for your page to give a personalized look to your TikTok. These are very minute details that are mostly eliminated, but they have a part in the growth of your <strong>unboxing TikTok</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-tiktok-4.jpg"                      alt="have a proper recording environment"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Be-Honest-and-Personable"><a href="#Tip-5-Be-Honest-and-Personable" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Be Honest and Personable"></a>Tip 5: Be Honest and Personable</h3><p>Now, many content creators boost a product that is actually not that good. Before selecting a product for an <strong>unboxing video TikTok</strong>, confirm whether it is worth it or not. Never give false information about the product because it will cause a negative impression on viewers. Always explain the item’s specs and price and guide the viewer if that is budget-friendly.</p><p>Above all, categorize the products in variable names like bags, shoes, and clothes so viewers can watch videos without hassle. If you are working on makeup and skincare products, mention their expiry dates, size, and other factors.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Ask-People-to-Follow-Like-Comment-and-Share"><a href="#Tip-6-Ask-People-to-Follow-Like-Comment-and-Share" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Ask People to Follow, Like, Comment and Share"></a>Tip 6: Ask People to Follow, Like, Comment and Share</h3><p>Communication is the key to better understanding and higher productivity. Conversing with the audience and then asking them to follow your page is not as bad as many think. If you are putting effort into something, you should claim it to the fullest and ask others to appreciate you. At the end of your <strong>unboxing video,</strong> always asks viewers to like, share and follow your page.</p><p>Above all, never hesitate to ask other opinions in the comment section. It will not only maximize followers on your page but also show your generous attitude toward your audience.</p><h3 id="Tip-7-Use-a-Professional-Video-Editing-App"><a href="#Tip-7-Use-a-Professional-Video-Editing-App" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Use a Professional Video Editing App"></a>Tip 7: Use a Professional Video Editing App</h3><p>This is the most fundamental part of every type of video.

The former runs on the mobile devices while the later runs with the computers and other gaming devices. There are so many different kinds of products for both these kinds to choose from.</p><h2 id="Difference-Between-Mobile-and-Tethered-VR-Headsets"><a href="#Difference-Between-Mobile-and-Tethered-VR-Headsets" class="headerlink" title="Difference Between Mobile and Tethered VR Headsets"></a>Difference Between Mobile and Tethered VR Headsets</h2><p> If we talk about Tethered headsets, we see that they have combined displays, and they usually connect to personal computers or also to game systems using a cable. Whereas on the other hand, mobile headsets typically use smartphones for the display as well as processing; and in the absence of a smartphone, they’re nothing but just shells having lenses.</p><p> Tethered headsets designed to be large, they are expensive, and as well as they are also resource-intensive. They also claim more innovative motion-sensing and head-tracking abilities in opposite to mobile headsets. Other than that, not just the larger headsets consist of extensively devoted motion sensors, they also often work in combination with outside cameras to more exactly track the user’s head. Adding to that, they’re also designed to work with bodily controls, starting from keyboards and gamepads to more exclusive possibilities.</p><p> Now if we talk about the mobile headsets, they are small in size and cheap in price as compared to PC VR Headset. The reason is the most of the work is actually done by the smartphone, so the maximum price of mobile headset could be $100. Most of the mobile headsets are grounded on the Google Cardboard prototype, and with the exclusion of a magnetic switch, they do not have any motorized or electric components in the design; they are only screens with the lenses that divide user’s smartphone’s screen absolutely into two when he holds it to his face.</p><h2 id="When-to-Choose-Mobile-Headset-or-a-VR-Headset-Purchasing-Suggestions"><a href="#When-to-Choose-Mobile-Headset-or-a-VR-Headset-Purchasing-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="When to Choose Mobile Headset or a VR Headset? Purchasing Suggestions"></a>When to Choose Mobile Headset or a VR Headset? Purchasing Suggestions</h2><p> It is a very common question nowadays that what VR kind should be preferred to buy, tethered or mobile. Well, according to their use and qualities both of them are best in some senses and both of them has flaws in some other senses. It all depends on what needs do the user has. Now there are 2 options if you want a headset to try out this new technology and you want this gadget to be always with you wherever you go, you need to buy a mobile VR headset. But in the other case, if you want to completely enjoy this technology with powerful displays and want to have the best experience then there is no doubt you need to buy a tethered VR headset. It also depends on how much money do you have, because the tethered VR headset is very expensive because of its extra functionalities and ruthless display, whereas mobile VR headset are not so much good at display but they are cheap and an average person can easily afford them.</p><h3 id="Some-of-the-best-of-both-the-worlds"><a href="#Some-of-the-best-of-both-the-worlds" class="headerlink" title="Some of the best of both the worlds"></a>Some of the best of both the worlds</h3><p> LG’s new 360 VR, though, is present someplace in the mid of the best of the mobile headsets. It has its particular lenses and also the display but it is also tethered to the LG G5 mobile with the help of a USB cable. You can regulate things also with buttons present on the HMD or as well as by pushing and long-pressing the display of the smartphone. Audio voice can also come from the headphone jack present on the HMD or through the phone’s earphone port. It is still restricted by the smartphone’s dispensation power but by the presence of its personal lenses, it’s considerably well adapted to virtual reality as compared to Google Cardboard.</p><p> One of the other huge results of a tethered smartphone connection is of the 360 VR is very lighter in weight and debatably more contented than rather like the Gear VR, and it permits for adjustment of the optics. Though it may look awkward, it’s actually not considerably different than the 1st Sony Walkman, which also listed a trivial head gadget which is driven by a tethered device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-fast-tracked-finesse-how-to-efficiently-edit-and-enhance-windows-photos/"><u>2024 Approved  Fast-Tracked Finesse  How to Efficiently Edit and Enhance Windows Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-industrial-giants-taking-flight-heavy-duty-drones/"><u>[Updated] Industrial Giants Taking Flight  Heavy-Duty Drones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-amateur-to-expert-15-must-knows-in-tiktok-video-edits/"><u>In 2024, From Amateur to Expert  15 Must-Knows in TikTok Video Edits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploring-interconnected-digital-universes-meta-and-omni/"><u>2024 Approved  Exploring Interconnected Digital Universes  Meta & Omni</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-fine-tune-your-digital-discussions-zooming-upwards/"><u>[New] Fine-Tune Your Digital Discussions  Zooming Upwards</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-effectively-download-huge-quantities-of-tiktok-content/"><u>2024 Approved  How to Effectively Download Huge Quantities of TikTok Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-fuse-sounds-with-slides-a-guide-to-mp3-integration/"><u>[Updated] Fuse Sounds with Slides  A Guide to MP3 Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-from-basic-to-exceptional-gopro-filming-techniques/"><u>[New] From Basic to Exceptional  Gopro Filming Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-ideal-virtual-reality-systems-for-drones/"><u>In 2024, Ideal Virtual Reality Systems for Drones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-perfect-planning-how-to-schedule-your-online-teams-virtual-gatherings-google/"><u>[New] In 2024, Perfect Planning  How to Schedule Your Online Team's Virtual Gatherings (Google)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/7-ways-to-unlock-a-locked-infinix-smart-8-plus-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>7 Ways to Unlock a Locked Infinix Smart 8 Plus Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/two-ways-to-track-my-boyfriends-oppo-reno-11f-5g-without-him-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Two Ways to Track My Boyfriends Oppo Reno 11F 5G without Him Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-igtv-to-fb-exposure-strategies-6-essential-tips/"><u>[New] In 2024, IGTV to FB Exposure Strategies (6 Essential Tips)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfect-shadows-and-highlights-with-iphone-lighting-tips/"><u>In 2024, Perfect Shadows & Highlights with IPhone Lighting Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-change-ratio-of-video-in-a-quick-and-easy-way/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved How to Change Ratio of Video in a Quick & Easy Way</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-frp-hijacker-by-hagard-download-and-bypass-your-motorola-edge-40-frp-locks-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, FRP Hijacker by Hagard Download and Bypass your Motorola Edge 40 FRP Locks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-elevate-tiktok-visuals-switch-backgrounds-with-confidence-and-precision-for-2024/"><u>[New] Elevate TikTok Visuals  Switch Backgrounds with Confidence and Precision for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-cast-poco-m6-5g-screen-to-pc-using-wifi-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Cast Poco M6 5G Screen to PC Using WiFi | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-immediate-insta-photo-series-viewing/"><u>[New] In 2024, Immediate Insta Photo Series Viewing</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

However, do you realize that you can use speech-to-text technology in PowerPoint? Yes! It is effortless and fun-filled: dictate, and create presentable slides with your speech. What is more fun than speaking and seeing your speech in electronic formats? This article teaches how you can create presentations via speech-to-text technology and how you can use real-time translation in PowerPoint.</p><p><strong>Best Speech-To-Text Software</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text to make perfect PPT videos.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-speech-to-text-in-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-speech-to-text-in-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint?"></a>Part 1: How to enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint?</h2><p>Using speech-to-text in PowerPoint is the same principle guiding other platforms like Microsoft Words. Also, PowerPoint presentation on a windows device is similar to a Mac. However, some control and key functions differ in the two devices. The only thing you should note when you want to use the speech-to-text function is the type of device you are using. You can enable “speech-to-text” on devices like Mac, Windows, and mobile phones.</p><p>Please note that “enabling speech-to-text” in PowerPoint differs from “using speech-to-text.” For example, you have to enable the speech-to-text first before you can use it. Also, how you enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint is based on the selected devices. Let’s discuss enabling speech-to-text on Mac and Windows.</p><h3 id="Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac"><a href="#Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Enable speech-to-text on Mac"></a><strong>Enable speech-to-text on Mac</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Select the control button:</strong> Mac allows you to select the control button for activating speech-to-text the first time you want to use the feature. Unlike other devices, the control option pops up when you select the speech-to-text option. It then displays some control options so that you can select the button suitable for you.</li><li><strong>Activate the feature:</strong> click on the apple logo on your Mac, and select <strong>“system preference.”</strong> Select <strong>“keyboard”</strong> options displayed in the system preference.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-1.jpg"                      alt="click on the apple logo"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Select the dictation option:</strong> select dictation from the keyboard option and check the <strong>“on&#x2F;off”</strong> The option also has an advanced feature that allows additional commands.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-2.jpg"                      alt="select the dictation option"                ></p><p>Once you activate the dictation from the command button, you can use the speech-to-text feature anywhere you can type on Mac - this applies to PowerPoint. However, you may need some tweaking on PowerPoint to finally use the feature as you prepare your slides.</p><h3 id="Enable-speech-to-text-on-Windows"><a href="#Enable-speech-to-text-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Enable speech-to-text on Windows"></a><strong>Enable speech-to-text on Windows</strong></h3><p>Aside from the regular Cortana speech recognition on Windows, you can use the speech-to-text feature on PowerPoint. PowerPoint supports “speech-to-text” when you use the program; however, activating the Windows device through the <strong>built-in speech recognition</strong> makes the process easy and effective. Some windows PC, just like Mac, lets you first activate the speech recognition function before you proceed and use it on PowerPoint.</p><ul><li>On PowerPoint, click on the microphone icon on the left corner of your PowerPoint’s homepage. If the speech-to-text feature is not activated on your device, you can follow the instruction to activate it. Peradventure you do not have PowerPoint installed on your device, you can activate the dictation feature through the command button or search feature on windows.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-3.jpg"                      alt="click on the microphone icon"                ></p><ul><li>Click on the search button and type <strong>“dictation”</strong> or “<strong>speech services</strong>,” and the device redirects you to settings. Here, you activate the dictation button as the Mac option explained earlier. You may also press <strong>“windows key + H”</strong> to start the dictation option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-4.jpg"                      alt="click on the search button"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-do-I-dictate-PowerPoint-for-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-do-I-dictate-PowerPoint-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How do I dictate PowerPoint for Mac?"></a>Part 2: How do I dictate PowerPoint for Mac?</h2><p>It is easy to use PowerPoint on a Mac after activating the <strong>“dictation”</strong> button.</p><h3 id="Add-speak-to-the-quick-access-toolbar"><a href="#Add-speak-to-the-quick-access-toolbar" class="headerlink" title="Add speak to the quick access toolbar"></a><strong>Add speak to the quick access toolbar</strong></h3><ul><li>Sign in to the PowerPoint on your Mac device, and locate the customized <strong>quick access toolbar.</strong> The quick access toolbar includes <strong>“more commands”</strong> and other options.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-5.jpg"                      alt="more commands and other options"                ></p><ul><li>Reselect the option to “<strong>all commands</strong>.” The “all commands” should be enabled because they include many other commands, but you may not activate the options without selecting them.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-6.jpg"                      alt="reselect the option"                ></p><ul><li>From “all commands,” locate the speak option and add the option.

There are cases you need to activate speech-to-text in a life event. PowerPoint supports this through the “speech-to-text” feature available on the platform.</p><h3 id="Set-up-captions-and-subtitles"><a href="#Set-up-captions-and-subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Set up captions and subtitles"></a><strong>Set up captions and subtitles</strong></h3><p>Real-time display and translation are suitable for the multi-language purpose. You can select the real-time option on your PowerPoint and makes it display another subtitle in other languages. Thus, when you speak in a language, the captions or subtitles display another text (speech-to-text) in a different language.</p><ul><li>Click on the <strong>slide show</strong>, and go to <strong>subtitle settings</strong>; select <strong>spoken languages.</strong> The spoken language is the “speech input language”: the language you will speak to be translated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-8.jpg"                      alt="click on the slide show"                ></p><ul><li>After setting the spoken language, move on to set the <strong>subtitle&#x2F;caption language.</strong> The subtitle or caption language is the translated language. PowerPoint allows you to translate speech without using an application. You can make a multi-language selection without much involvement - just settings.</li></ul><p><strong>Tips:</strong> Many options are available for easy use and accessibility. Aside from the multi-language selection, you can explore the “slide show” settings for better understanding. You may see other options that best illustrate your need for translation in real-time on PowerPoint.</p><p>When you activate the real-time translation on PowerPoint, the settings occur in two stages: slideshow view and presenter view. You can vary the changes based on your view (as the presenter) or what people see (slideshow view).</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos"></a>Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos</h2><p>When you want to make perfect PPT videos, you can use Filmora’s STT feature. Wondershare Filmora Speech to Text is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms&#x2F;stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production. For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>What’s more, now Filmora’s STT feature supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles with up to 27 languages of transcription in Filmora version 13.</p><h3 id="Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT"><a href="#Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT" class="headerlink" title="Top Adavantages of Filmora STT"></a>Top Adavantages of Filmora STT</h3><ul><li>Supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles.</li><li>Allows to transcribe video speech to text in one click.</li><li>Boosts editing efficiency by applying the STT feature.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="Use-Filmora-STT-to-make-PowerPoint-videos-translation"><a href="#Use-Filmora-STT-to-make-PowerPoint-videos-translation" class="headerlink" title="Use Filmora STT to make PowerPoint videos translation"></a>Use Filmora STT to make PowerPoint videos translation</h3><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Select the audio asset in the timeline, and click the “Speech-to-Text” icon in the toolbar; if there is no supported file type on the timeline, it will not be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/guide-win/toolbar-stt.jpg"                      alt="toolbar stt"                ></p><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Click the “Speech-to-Text” icon, and it will show the parameter settings.

We are experiencing back to back changes in operating system both from Microsoft and from the newly launched Apple’s Mac. The latest OS version from Mac, MacOS Sierra is out now. Everyone is so curious to install this OS in their Macbook. There are loads of new features available in the new OS. But, there are many people who may not want to try this latest version as full time so early.</p><p>Though, this is the latest version but this doesn’t necessarily mean you will have the best experience with it all the time. So, if you have decided to downgrade to the older version that is OS X EI Capitan, we have the step by step solution for you. The steps are really simple to perform. So, here is how to downgrade from Mac OS Sierra to OS X EI Capitan.</p><p>Ok, so before we start, I just want to tell you one thing that either open this article on a different device or take a print out if you are right now reading this article on the very machine that you want to downgrade.</p><p>So, there are basically three steps of the whole process:</p><ul><li>Erase MacOS Sierra</li><li>Re-install OS X EI Capitan</li><li>Restore your data through time machine</li></ul><p>We will cover each step one by one so that it becomes easy to understand to all of you. And one more thing, you need to have an internet connection for this. So, here is the first step for you.</p><h3 id="Erase-MacOS-Sierra"><a href="#Erase-MacOS-Sierra" class="headerlink" title="Erase MacOS Sierra"></a>Erase MacOS Sierra</h3><p>1. First of all connect you Mac with a strong internet connection either through Wi-Fi or you can even use Ethernet connection. Make sure the connection is stable.</p><p>2. Now click on the “Apple” icon on your desktop.</p><p>3. You will see the dropdown menu there and you need to select “Restart” from the menu.</p><p>4. Now, do this step carefully. You need to hold down the Commanr+R together as soon as you hear the start up ding and keep holding till the time your computer reboots.</p><p>5. Now click on the “Disk Utility” button under the OS X Utilities section.</p><p>6. You will get the option to continue. Click on that.</p><p>7. Select your Startup Disk from the option.</p><p>8. At the top of the window you will see Earse tab. Click on that.</p><p>9. Now, enter the manes of the file you want to delete like MacOS Sierra.</p><p>10. Also select Mac OS Extended from the list and click Erase.</p><p>Once the process is completed quit the Disk Utility section from the dropdown, shown on the upper left corner of your screen. And go back to the OS X EI Capitan segment.</p><p>So, this is the end of the first step. Now we will move on to the next step that is reinstall OS X EI Capitan.</p><h3 id="Reinstall-Os-X-EI-Capitan"><a href="#Reinstall-Os-X-EI-Capitan" class="headerlink" title="Reinstall Os X EI Capitan"></a>Reinstall Os X EI Capitan</h3><p>Now that you have erased the present version of the OS from your Mac, you would like to install an older version for sure.</p><p>1.Go to the OS X Utilities selector and click on the “Reinstall OS X” from the dropdown.</p><p>2. Here you will see the EI Capitan installation window and click on “Continue”.</p><p>Here I would like to mention something. Depending on the date of purchase of your Mac, you may download an older version of Mac OS. You can even install the one that your Mac was shipped with. But for this you have to complete the process with Internet Recovery Mode. You can install older versions like Mavericks or Yosemite. When the installation is done open the Mac App Store. And here you will see OS X EI Capitan in your purchased list, download that. The OS will install like the standard upgrade. You have to agree with licensing terms for this.</p><p>So, we are only one step farther from the whole process to be completed. Here is the final step for you.</p><h3 id="Restore-your-data-from-Time-Machine"><a href="#Restore-your-data-from-Time-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Restore your data from Time Machine"></a>Restore your data from Time Machine</h3><p>Like it is always recommended to backup your present data through Time Machine, if you have your data saved, you can use that to reinstall in the present OS that is OS X EI Capitan by following these simple steps:</p><p>1. First of all connect your Mac with internet through Wi-Fi or Ethernet.</p><p>2. Click on the “Apple” icon shown on the desktop.</p><p>3. Click on the dropdown and select Restart from the list.</p><p>4. Hold on the Command+R as soon as you hear the startup tone and hold the key till the reboot.</p><p>5. Now go to the “Restore from Time Machine Backup” in the OS X Utilities selector.</p><p>6. Click “Continue” twice and read the important information about backup before proceeding.</p><p>7. Select the Backup source where the backup data will be stored.</p><p>8. Select most recent OS X EI Capitan backup and continue.</p><p>Hah… You are done now. Your Mac will start restoring the data from Time Machine and will reboot. This may take a while depending on your system configuration. So, just sit and relax.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-harmonious-hush-managing-music-on-pc-mac/"><u>2024 Approved  Harmonious Hush  Managing Music on PC, Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-getting-to-know-the-premium-p2715q-a-high-definition-marvel/"><u>In 2024, Getting to Know the Premium P2715Q  A High-Definition Marvel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-expert-picks-the-leading-18-webcam-capture-apps/"><u>[New] Expert Picks  The Leading 18 Webcam Capture Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/immersive-metaverse-reflections-inspirational-messages-for-2024/"><u>Immersive Metaverse Reflections  Inspirational Messages for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-exploring-the-universe-of-gesture-technology/"><u>[Updated] Exploring the Universe of Gesture Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-expert-insights-into-the-world-of-google-photos/"><u>[Updated] Expert Insights Into the World of Google Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-from-standard-to-spectacular-your-guide-to-selecting-a-stellar-4k-display/"><u>[New] From Standard to Spectacular  Your Guide to Selecting a Stellar 4K Display</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-fostering-an-online-oasis-paving-the-way-for-a-prolific-youtube-presence/"><u>[New] Fostering an Online Oasis  Paving the Way for a Prolific Youtube Presence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-detect-and-stop-mspy-from-spying-on-your-vivo-x-flip-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Detect and Stop mSpy from Spying on Your Vivo X Flip | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/ways-to-trade-pokemon-go-from-far-away-on-honor-80-pro-straight-screen-edition-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Ways to trade pokemon go from far away On Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-picks-of-firefox-tools-to-streamline-your-facebook-video-experience-2023/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Top Picks of Firefox Tools to Streamline Your Facebook Video Experience, 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-leading-8-tools-for-subtitle-srt-format-switching-for-2024/"><u>[New] Leading 8 Tools for Subtitle-SRT Format Switching for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-copy-contacts-from-apple-iphone-12-pro-to-sim-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Copy Contacts from Apple iPhone 12 Pro to SIM? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-screen-replayer-apps-for-modern-web-surfing/"><u>In 2024, Top Screen Replayer Apps for Modern Web Surfing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-smile-slam-the-best-comedy-moments-on-social-media-for-2024/"><u>[New] Smile Slam  The Best Comedy Moments on Social Media for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-by-phone-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Track Samsung Galaxy A15 5G by Phone Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/resolving-mobile-video-sending-problems-in-fb-chat-for-2024/"><u>Resolving Mobile Video Sending Problems in FB Chat for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

This monitor is designed with extra sharp resolution, precise hue adjustment and many more settings that suits to business environments. However, many gamers love to play games on its wider screen that delivers classic response for graphics. This 32 inch monitor is designed to maintain higher color accuracy. There are lots of unique specifications and advanced features that you need to know about HP DreamColor Z32X before making your next investment for a 4K monitor. The review below will help you to know most of interesting things about this big screen display.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>It delivers excellent response for color reproduction.</li><li>Offers intuitive on screen controls.</li><li>Delivers highly accurate gamma performance.</li><li>Picture quality is impressive enough.</li><li>There are lots of intuitive controls over screen.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Contrast settings still need little improvement.</li><li>It generates noticeable ghosting effect.</li><li>Few screen adjustments demand additional built in tools.</li></ul><h2 id="HP-DreamColor-Z32X-Hardware-Design"><a href="#HP-DreamColor-Z32X-Hardware-Design" class="headerlink" title="HP DreamColor Z32X Hardware Design"></a>HP DreamColor Z32X Hardware Design</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hp-dreamcolor-z32x-design.jpg"                      alt="hp-dreamcolor-z32x-design"                ></p><p> DreamColor Z32X ensures powerful aesthetics with professional style finesse and its highly functional design assists in easy usage. Most of users would not like its thicker bezel but you will not find them much distracting. The panel is finished with matte black finish but it is not much stylish. The whole exterior of this 4K monitor is designed using plastic material and the craftsmanship is definitely appealing. The assembly is perfectly adjusted and it seems durable enough with fine design option. How can we forget to talk about its stand that has minimalistic design. All these features make this monitor suitable for business applications but you may have to make little efforts to create space for this large size monitor. The stand is durable enough and can easily handle this large size monitor. It can be easily adjusted for pivot, swivel, tilt and height shifts as per need. There is a well managed hole that helps to manage all cables very well and this monitor can also be used with VESA mount.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Ports and Connectivity"></a>2. Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hp-dreamcolor-z32x-ports.jpg"                      alt="hp-dreamcolor-z32x-ports"                ></p><p> If we talk about the connectivity and ports then you will be able to manage enough peripheral connections with ease.

You will find two USB ports on rear side of this monitor whereas rest two are available on left bezel. It also includes one 3.5mm audio jack but the speakers are missing in this 4K monitor. However, users can access LCD speakers of HP via this audio jack.</p><h2 id="HP-DreamColor-Z32X-Features-and-Performance"><a href="#HP-DreamColor-Z32X-Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="HP DreamColor Z32X Features and Performance"></a>HP DreamColor Z32X Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-On-Screen-Controls-and-Settings"><a href="#1-On-Screen-Controls-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1.On Screen Controls and Settings"></a>1.On Screen Controls and Settings</h4><p> Most of the settings for improving performance of this monitor can be done from five simple buttons. Although, these buttons are not much stylish and not even like joystick based controls but still you will find them useful enough as they work well. It is much easier to make adjustments for contrast and brightness from on screen controls.</p><p> This monitor serves users with wide list of image quality adjustment options such as picture in picture, image scaling, sharpness, in depth RGB personalization, BT.709, AdobeRGB, sRGB and brightness. These settings not only supports fine calibrations but at the same time they assist in handling several input sources at a time and also manage low resolution response. With all these advanced colors, you will miss a few essential ones like color temperature settings and gamma controls. If you want to adjust them then it is advised to buy HP DreamColor Calibration Solution Kit.</p><h4 id="2-Color-and-Image-Quality"><a href="#2-Color-and-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2. Color and Image Quality"></a>2. Color and Image Quality</h4><p> HP DreamColor ensures 3840 by 2160 resolution on its 32 inch 4K monitor where you can manage content at refresh rate of 60 Hz frequency range. This monitor comes with pre calibration from factory itself where sRGB can produce 96% response and Adobe RGB technology leads to 92% accuracy. The Delta E value is rated to be 0.9. All these values need little improvement to meet professional needs but if we talk about the gamma curve then it is observed to be at 2.2 with lower threshold adjustment for error.</p><p> Moving ahead towards contrast settings, this 4K monitor delivers 520:1 contrast with brightness level of 50%. The gamma range is again fixed at 2.2 that delivers bland response for grays and blacks but the overall shades appear much lighter as compared to standard settings. The screen delivers fine response for artwork and pictures with its enhanced settings for saturation and vibrancy that makes things lifelike. Results can be further enhanced with adjustments of advanced filters such as BT.709, AdobeRGB and sRGB.</p><h4 id="3-Calibration"><a href="#3-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="3. Calibration"></a>3. Calibration</h4><p> DreamColor Z32X comes with factory calibration and it represented satisfactory performance for out of box tests. When adjusted to AdobeRGB mode, it leads to 92 percent accuracy whereas sRGB color gamut response was observed to be 96%. You will find its Gamma curve sitting at perfect value of 2.2 where professionals noticed average difference in color of 0.88 only. With all these features, this monitor result stunning color reproduction and it is rated to deliver impressive color distribution even when it is turned on for the very first time. The out of box performance can be little improved with the help of post calibration settings. After applying these adjustments, sRGB response was improved up to 97% whereas Adobe RGB was increased up to 93%. It leads to little decrease in color error where value shifted to 0.84 from 0.88. Even with these small improvements, the color delivery was much improved.</p><h4 id="4-Gaming-Performance"><a href="#4-Gaming-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4.Gaming Performance"></a>4.Gaming Performance</h4><p> As this 4K monitor is dedicated to professional display needs but it cannot be recommended to high end gamers. The major reason behind its degraded performance for latest UHD gaming needs is the limited responsiveness. This device is observed to have slow pixel transition rating of 8ms. This issue further leads to noticeable ghosting and interlacing troubles. If you want to get rid this of it then it is advised to choose a faster monitor that can manage graphic card response with faster refresh rate and faster response time. Its response time for gray to gray adjustment, input lag and ghosting effect does not allow gamers to have fine gaming response on this monitor. Gamers are more dedicated to receive sensitive response for all these artefacts so they cannot accept this unacceptable flaw.</p><h4 id="5-Responsiveness"><a href="#5-Responsiveness" class="headerlink" title="5.Responsiveness"></a>5.Responsiveness</h4><p> While testing responsiveness of this 32 inch 4K monitor it was found suitable for casual needs because if you prefer to use it for faster sessions or like bleeding edge monitors then it will cause delays. However, when its performance was compared to Samsung U32D970Q then it was found little faster than that. Although, this monitor has lots of advanced features and it works fine for most of office and studio needs but due to absence of G-Sync and FreeSync it is not able to deliver satisfactory performance for gaming needs. Professional gamers are advised to drop the idea to buy HP DreamColor but it looks fine for photo and video lovers.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> HP Dream Color Z32X is well known for its excellent professional quality service; the precise color delivery with higher resolution management leads to better performance.
