It was first invented in the 1970s by Garrett Brown. He used his background as a Hollywood director of photography with experience in major motion pictures to create the device for film production purposes. Steadicams are typically suspended from the operator’s body at chest level, known as “the shoulder mount.” The armature fits over one of the operator’s shoulders and attaches to their belt or harness around their waist while they control its movement using two handles - one for each hand.</p><p>They are generally used when shooting video in recording situations where the camera needs to move free of vibration or shake. This includes handheld, shoulder-mounted, tripod, sliders, and other stabilizing equipment.</p><p>Because of its portability, a Steadicam allows directors to shoot in locations that might otherwise not have been suitable for conventional complex camera setups. It also enables cinematographers to create moving shots, which are difficult or impossible without one. A Steadicam can also be used to “fly” through scenes by attaching the camera to a crane or dolly while allowing the operator to walk free if desired.</p><p>The Steadicam is handy in film production because it allows for stable footage even when utilizing very long lenses and uneven terrain. This means that if you are working on a budget, you can avoid spending money on equipment rentals that may not fit your schedule or needs. Steadicams have become an essential filming tool because of how flexible they are in any situation - there’s no longer a need for specialized equipment or setups for specific shots. They are vital tools that allow you greater creative freedom with many types of images, all while achieving excellent quality footage.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-types-of-Steadicams-are-there"><a href="#Part-2-What-types-of-Steadicams-are-there" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What types of Steadicams are there?"></a>Part 2: What types of Steadicams are there?</h2><p>Three types of Steadicams are currently on the market.</p><p><strong>The Classic Steadicam:</strong> This is the original design by Garrett Brown and is still in use today.

It was first invented in the 1970s by Garrett Brown. He used his background as a Hollywood director of photography with experience in major motion pictures to create the device for film production purposes. Steadicams are typically suspended from the operator’s body at chest level, known as “the shoulder mount.” The armature fits over one of the operator’s shoulders and attaches to their belt or harness around their waist while they control its movement using two handles - one for each hand.</p><p>They are generally used when shooting video in recording situations where the camera needs to move free of vibration or shake. This includes handheld, shoulder-mounted, tripod, sliders, and other stabilizing equipment.</p><p>Because of its portability, a Steadicam allows directors to shoot in locations that might otherwise not have been suitable for conventional complex camera setups. It also enables cinematographers to create moving shots, which are difficult or impossible without one. A Steadicam can also be used to “fly” through scenes by attaching the camera to a crane or dolly while allowing the operator to walk free if desired.</p><p>The Steadicam is handy in film production because it allows for stable footage even when utilizing very long lenses and uneven terrain. This means that if you are working on a budget, you can avoid spending money on equipment rentals that may not fit your schedule or needs. Steadicams have become an essential filming tool because of how flexible they are in any situation - there’s no longer a need for specialized equipment or setups for specific shots. They are vital tools that allow you greater creative freedom with many types of images, all while achieving excellent quality footage.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-types-of-Steadicams-are-there-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-types-of-Steadicams-are-there-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What types of Steadicams are there?"></a>Part 2: What types of Steadicams are there?</h2><p>Three types of Steadicams are currently on the market.</p><p><strong>The Classic Steadicam:</strong> This is the original design by Garrett Brown and is still in use today. It has a two-point support system, which gives it more stability but decreases mobility slightly.</p><p><strong>The Merlin:</strong> This was designed as a more portable version of the classic Steadicam and used a three-point support system for better stability.</p><p><strong>The Ultra:</strong> This is the most recent addition to Steadicams and has a two-point support system, which makes it easy to set up and use quickly but decreases stability slightly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Steadicams-for-DSRL-Filming-3"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Steadicams-for-DSRL-Filming-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Steadicams for DSRL Filming"></a>Part 3: Best Steadicams for DSRL Filming</h2><h3 id="1-Zhiyun-Crane-M-3-Axis-Steadicam-with-gimbal-3"><a href="#1-Zhiyun-Crane-M-3-Axis-Steadicam-with-gimbal-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

This will help in collecting more light from the view and the more time the shutter will take to close, the more ‘light’ will it be able to gather to the sensor. Along with this, ensure to have a wide aperture so that the subject exposure will be adequate. Hence, the first tip tells you to let more light enter to the lens by slowing shutter speed for a better photo in dim light through the iPhone.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >iPhone Night Photography Tips: Take Night Photos with iPhone &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Take Long Exposure Shots on iPhone &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/long-trails-exposure.jpg"                      alt="long-trails-exposure"                ></p><p> Image source: iPhone Mad</p><h4 id="2-Stabilize-your-camera"><a href="#2-Stabilize-your-camera" class="headerlink" title="2.  Stabilize your camera"></a>2.  Stabilize your camera</h4><p> When following the first tip, it is necessary to keep the camera stable to avoid any blurry or shaky image. You would not want a clumsy dim light image, right? Therefore, the next tip includes keeping your camera still and steady. You can either hold the camera tightly or place it at a stable fixed object like a tripod or door frame for support. Try this technique and you will definitely get a perfect image you want to capture even in the low light.</p><h4 id="3-Use-flash-sparingly"><a href="#3-Use-flash-sparingly" class="headerlink" title="3.  Use flash sparingly"></a>3.  Use flash sparingly</h4><p> ‘Flash or no Flash’, that is the question. Well! Flash has always been there to give a better result while photographing with iPhone. Here, we would recommend you to use flash in small quantities when want to work with iPhone in dim light photography. There are times when using a flash goes pointless giving you a very undesirable results. When you wish to click a faraway subject, working with flash for low light iPhone photography can be inadequate. Also, please note that this recommendation is not for all digital cameras.</p><h4 id="4-Don’t-zoom"><a href="#4-Don’t-zoom" class="headerlink" title="4.  Don’t zoom"></a>4.  Don’t zoom</h4><p> Contrasting the list of all the do’s for better low light photography, here is one ‘don’t’ that you must follow for having what you desire i.e. to get a perfect dim light photo with your iPhone. The rule says ‘Don’t Zoom’ while thinking about photography with your iPhone. A common photography saying goes “zoom with your feet” which means it’s better to move a little further to the subject rather than opting for zooming option. And this is indeed true for Smartphone cases since the device’s inbuilt camera contains a worthless zoom feature. You can rarely think of using digital zooming when shooting picture with your iPhone, one on five times, to be precise and that too when doing day time photography. Don’t ever think of it for low light photography as it will result in grainy look as well as reduced resolution than original. If you can’t move closer, we would suggest you cropping the picture post capturing. This will also keep the resolution intact.</p><h4 id="5-Use-HDR-to-get-details"><a href="#5-Use-HDR-to-get-details" class="headerlink" title="5.  Use HDR to get details"></a>5.  Use HDR to get details</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hdr-on-off-iphone.jpg"                      alt="hdr-on-off-iphone"                ></p><p> Image source: Gadgetzz</p><p> Another helpful tip you should know when using iPhone for low light shooting is to make use of HDR feature of the iPhone’s camera. This will help you in highlighting the details what the normal camera can miss. With the HDR feature, you will come up with the best quality low light photo detailing the exposures in an improved way. Ergo, the fifth technique that will assist you in snapping an excellent view when there is low light will be going along with HDR effect.</p><h4 id="6-Convert-to-black-and-white"><a href="#6-Convert-to-black-and-white" class="headerlink" title="6. Convert to black and white"></a>6. Convert to black and white</h4><p> A yet another tip you can follow when having tried all above is capturing the photo in black and white. This could help you when you fail in every mentioned attempt above. Black and white will not leave you in any way. Even the grainy shots take benefit of black and white effect and seem more acceptable than in colored pictures. Sticking and adapting to ‘black and white’ is sometimes handy when you are in the mood of low light iPhone photography.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-photo-black-and-white.jpg"                      alt="set-photo-black-and-white"                ></p><p> Image resource: Pexels</p><h4 id="7-Post-production"><a href="#7-Post-production" class="headerlink" title="7. Post production"></a>7. Post production</h4><p> Post production, keeping the honesty, refers to doing a little cheating in order to create the low light shots non-clumsy. In other words, this technique wants to explain you to taking the desired shot at day time and adding few filters to the shot ultimately making it similar to a night time shot. For instance, by using blue or darker filters or say under-exposure, you can yourself produce a deceptive night impression. You are not new to filters and it would be not wrong to say you have worked with filters before</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best iPhone Phone Editing Apps for iPhone X&#x2F;8&#x2F;7&#x2F;6 &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-exclusive-metaverse-playmates-list-roundup/"><u>[Updated] Exclusive Metaverse Playmates' List Roundup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-full-reviewed-evaluation-hero4-black-capabilities/"><u>2024 Approved  Full Reviewed Evaluation  Hero4 Black Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/exploring-intensified-illumination-for-advanced-hdr-video-for-2024/"><u>Exploring Intensified Illumination for Advanced HDR Video for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-innovative-techniques-for-captivating-ae-titles/"><u>[New] Innovative Techniques for Captivating AE Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/full-exploration-new-features-in-videoshow-app-24-for-2024/"><u>Full Exploration  New Features in VideoShow App '24 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploiting-b-roll-for-visual-impact-on-projects/"><u>2024 Approved  Exploiting B Roll for Visual Impact on Projects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-harmonizing-youtube-tracks-to-video-works/"><u>2024 Approved  Harmonizing YouTube Tracks to Video Works</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/smooth-integration-of-timestamps-into-desktopmobile-youtube-videos/"><u>Smooth Integration of Timestamps Into Desktop/Mobile YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-avi-to-mp4-how-to-cast-any-video-file-to-chromecast/"><u>Updated In 2024, From AVI to MP4 How to Cast Any Video File to Chromecast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-solving-the-puzzle-of-nonexistent-facebook-video-suggests/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Solving the Puzzle of Nonexistent Facebook Video Suggests</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unleash-your-creativity-with-these-5-premium-mp3-recorder-apps/"><u>New In 2024, Unleash Your Creativity with These 5 Premium MP3 Recorder Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-11-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Apple iPhone 11? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-how-to-find-videos-on-facebook-for-2024/"><u>[New] How to Find Videos on Facebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-jump-to-youtube-affiliate-ranking-with-a-swift-10000-views/"><u>[New] Jump to YouTube Affiliate Ranking with a Swift 10,000 Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/hitting-1080p-quality-with-facebook-broadcasting-for-2024/"><u>Hitting 1080P Quality with Facebook Broadcasting for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

If information is not delivered in a way that piques the listener’s attention and creates a picture in their mind, the human brain will typically lose interest. The podcast intro lasts for only about sixty seconds.</p><p>They say,</p><p>“The first impression is the last impression.”</p><p>So, how can you utilize these sixty seconds to hook the audience to your podcast? It is through crafting a dramatic intro with a script that it is bound to leave an impression on the listener.</p><p>If you’re new to podcasting or having difficulties attracting an audience, keep reading to get some scoop on how to compose an opening that will sweep the listener off his feet.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-podcasts-intros"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-podcasts-intros" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What are podcasts intros?"></a>Part 1. What are podcasts intros?</h2><p>A podcast intro is like a teaser that gives an insight into what the episode will be about. The introduction to the podcast usually appears at the start of the podcast.</p><p>Its duration varies from thirty to sixty seconds but acts as the determinant of the show’s success. A good podcast intro is like a warrior that aids in scoring the audience, competing with thousands of other openings.</p><p>A well-designed intro usually starts with a hook grabbing the listener’s undivided attention. So the listener would have no choice but to press the play button to find out more. So now, let’s see some key elements of a podcast intro.</p><ul><li><strong>The podcast’s name</strong> is critical to give the listener a sense of what they will be listening to.</li><li><strong>The episode title</strong> is a one-word summation of the entire episode’s content.</li><li><strong>Host introduction</strong>, introduce yourself and the co-hosts to the listener to develop familiarity.</li><li><strong>Background music</strong> draws the listener in and should be relevant to the introduction.</li><li><strong>The tagline</strong> is a major element that retains the listener’s interest.</li><li><strong>Sponsors</strong>, if you have any, put their names in the introduction.</li><li><strong>Disclaimer</strong>, if your podcast contains any spoilers, it should be mentioned in the disclaimer.</li></ul><p>Now that you know what a podcast intro is? Let’s discuss why it matters!</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-does-the-intro-to-podcasts-matter"><a href="#Part-2-Why-does-the-intro-to-podcasts-matter" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why does the intro to podcasts matter?"></a>Part 2. Why does the intro to podcasts matter?</h2><p>Podcasts have gained massive popularity over the last decade. Currently, over 30 million podcasts are available, making it even harder for you to gain an audience if you are starting a new podcast.</p><p>The game is to entice the listener so that he would want more, and for that, we need an intro that is powerful enough to intrigue the audience. After establishing why we need a podcast intro, let’s look at some sample intros from popular podcasts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-do-podcast-intros-in-trending-podcasts-sound-like"><a href="#Part-3-What-do-podcast-intros-in-trending-podcasts-sound-like" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

This podcast has around 2.2 million listeners. Ira Glass hosts the show, and episodes are released weekly. Ira introduces a new character in each episode and inquires about their background.</p><h3 id="My-favorite-murder"><a href="#My-favorite-murder" class="headerlink" title="My favorite murder"></a>My favorite murder</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcasts-intros-2.jpg"                      alt="my favorite murder"                ></p><p>My favorite murder is the fifth most popular podcast according to the US charts.

This podcast is very informative and addresses concerns that people face daily. Now let’s analyze the intros of the podcasts as mentioned above.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Elements&#x2F;Podcasts</th><th><em>This American Life</em></th><th><em>My favorite murder</em></th><th><em>Stuff you should know</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sound effects</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Length of the intro</td><td>60 seconds</td><td>50 seconds</td><td>40 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>Podcast name</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Intro of guests</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td></tr><tr><td>Disclaimer</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td></tr><tr><td>Genre (of the podcast)</td><td>Storytelling</td><td>Crime show</td><td>Informative</td></tr><tr><td>Podcast intro CTA</td><td>If you haven’t tried the previous episodes, you should, as the story will get deeper and more complicated.</td><td>It is the one where you can email us stories about your childhood pranks or any other incident, and you, too, can be a part of this show.</td><td>We all listen to the stuff you should know podcast to get to the bottom of the biggest mysteries of pop culture.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Table 1: shows the analysis of intros of the top 3 podcasts discussed above</em></p><p>Now that we’ve established which elements are more prominent in the intros of some of the most popular podcasts. Let’s review the essentials you should keep in mind when designing your introduction.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-make-a-good-podcast-intro"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-make-a-good-podcast-intro" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How to make a good podcast intro?"></a>Part 4. How to make a good podcast intro?</h2><p>If you want the audience to be unable to resist your podcast, design your podcast intro with the following tips in mind.</p><h3 id="How-long-should-a-podcast-intro-be"><a href="#How-long-should-a-podcast-intro-be" class="headerlink" title="How long should a podcast intro be?"></a>How long should a podcast intro be?</h3><p>Your podcast intro should be brief and snappy. The ideal duration for a podcast intro is between 30 to 60 seconds. However, it should not last more than a minute and a half.</p><p>The intro of “This American Life” lasted for sixty seconds, while the intro of stuff you should know was over in about forty seconds. Both of these intros were short and to the point. However, they did an excellent job of providing just the correct information to pique the audience’s interest.</p><h3 id="Is-background-music-helpful-in-making-the-intro-more-appealing"><a href="#Is-background-music-helpful-in-making-the-intro-more-appealing" class="headerlink" title="Is background music helpful in making the intro more appealing?"></a>Is background music helpful in making the intro more appealing?</h3><p>Selecting a soundtrack or sound effects for your podcast intro is optional, but it enhances the quality of the content presented. The soundtrack should be chosen carefully as it functions as a logo that presents a brand.</p><p>A soundtrack can also give a classy feel to your intro and aid the listeners in vibing to your content. For instance, if you intend to present horror content in your podcast, spooky background music and sound effects can help the listener get into the mood. To avoid copyright issues, you can find free music at the YouTube audio library or Pixabay.</p><h3 id="Should-you-include-a-call-to-action-in-your-intro-and-why"><a href="#Should-you-include-a-call-to-action-in-your-intro-and-why" class="headerlink" title="Should you include a call to action in your intro and why?"></a>Should you include a call to action in your intro and why?</h3><p>Including a call to action at the start or the end of your intro can serve as a good marketing strategy for your social media account. Call-to-action phrases such as, “if you like our podcast, be sure to leave us a review,” can also serve as a hook to capturing the listener’s attention.</p><p>In the call to action, you can ask your listeners to do any of the following.</p><ul><li>Recommend your podcast to their friend circle.</li><li>Visit your social media page and leave a review.</li><li>To listen to the previous episodes.</li><li>To buy your work, whether it’s a book or a magazine.</li></ul><p>A call to action is also effective in establishing familiarity with the listener. There is no right or wrong CTA, and you can select any given phrases that suit your podcast.</p><ul><li>If you enjoy our podcasts, don’t forget to subscribe.</li><li>Share our content with your friends and family; it’ll help us create more content.</li><li>If you like any changes in the format, do leave your suggestions in the comment box.</li></ul><p>For instance, in the intro of “This American Life,” Ira Glass uses the phrase, “If you haven’t tried the previous episodes yet, you should.” reminding the new audience to check the previous episodes as well.</p><h3 id="When-is-the-right-time-to-introduce-yourself-and-your-guests"><a href="#When-is-the-right-time-to-introduce-yourself-and-your-guests" class="headerlink" title="When is the right time to introduce yourself and your guests?"></a>When is the right time to introduce yourself and your guests?</h3><p>Logically it would help if you introduced yourself to the new audience right after introducing the name of your podcast. Introducing yourself is not challenging, but you can use guest introductions to create a buzz that will help you gain your listeners’ attention.</p><p>The proper way to introduce your episode guest is to tell your audience about their background, how you know them, and why you invited them to your podcast. It will pique the listener’s interest, and they will tune in to learn more. Now that you recognize what elements to pay attention to if you want to create a killer podcast intro.</p><p>Let’s look at the samples of some of the most popular podcast intros.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Effective-podcast-introduction-examples"><a href="#Part-5-Effective-podcast-introduction-examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Let’s review the essentials you should keep in mind when designing your introduction.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-make-a-good-podcast-intro-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-make-a-good-podcast-intro-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How to make a good podcast intro?"></a>Part 4. How to make a good podcast intro?</h2><p>If you want the audience to be unable to resist your podcast, design your podcast intro with the following tips in mind.</p><h3 id="How-long-should-a-podcast-intro-be-1"><a href="#How-long-should-a-podcast-intro-be-1" class="headerlink" title="How long should a podcast intro be?"></a>How long should a podcast intro be?</h3><p>Your podcast intro should be brief and snappy. The ideal duration for a podcast intro is between 30 to 60 seconds. However, it should not last more than a minute and a half.</p><p>The intro of “This American Life” lasted for sixty seconds, while the intro of stuff you should know was over in about forty seconds. Both of these intros were short and to the point. However, they did an excellent job of providing just the correct information to pique the audience’s interest.</p><h3 id="Is-background-music-helpful-in-making-the-intro-more-appealing-1"><a href="#Is-background-music-helpful-in-making-the-intro-more-appealing-1" class="headerlink" title="Is background music helpful in making the intro more appealing?"></a>Is background music helpful in making the intro more appealing?</h3><p>Selecting a soundtrack or sound effects for your podcast intro is optional, but it enhances the quality of the content presented. The soundtrack should be chosen carefully as it functions as a logo that presents a brand.</p><p>A soundtrack can also give a classy feel to your intro and aid the listeners in vibing to your content. For instance, if you intend to present horror content in your podcast, spooky background music and sound effects can help the listener get into the mood. To avoid copyright issues, you can find free music at the YouTube audio library or Pixabay.</p><h3 id="Should-you-include-a-call-to-action-in-your-intro-and-why-1"><a href="#Should-you-include-a-call-to-action-in-your-intro-and-why-1" class="headerlink" title="Should you include a call to action in your intro and why?"></a>Should you include a call to action in your intro and why?</h3><p>Including a call to action at the start or the end of your intro can serve as a good marketing strategy for your social media account. Call-to-action phrases such as, “if you like our podcast, be sure to leave us a review,” can also serve as a hook to capturing the listener’s attention.</p><p>In the call to action, you can ask your listeners to do any of the following.</p><ul><li>Recommend your podcast to their friend circle.</li><li>Visit your social media page and leave a review.</li><li>To listen to the previous episodes.</li><li>To buy your work, whether it’s a book or a magazine.</li></ul><p>A call to action is also effective in establishing familiarity with the listener. There is no right or wrong CTA, and you can select any given phrases that suit your podcast.</p><ul><li>If you enjoy our podcasts, don’t forget to subscribe.</li><li>Share our content with your friends and family; it’ll help us create more content.</li><li>If you like any changes in the format, do leave your suggestions in the comment box.</li></ul><p>For instance, in the intro of “This American Life,” Ira Glass uses the phrase, “If you haven’t tried the previous episodes yet, you should.” reminding the new audience to check the previous episodes as well.</p><h3 id="When-is-the-right-time-to-introduce-yourself-and-your-guests-1"><a href="#When-is-the-right-time-to-introduce-yourself-and-your-guests-1" class="headerlink" title="When is the right time to introduce yourself and your guests?"></a>When is the right time to introduce yourself and your guests?</h3><p>Logically it would help if you introduced yourself to the new audience right after introducing the name of your podcast. Introducing yourself is not challenging, but you can use guest introductions to create a buzz that will help you gain your listeners’ attention.</p><p>The proper way to introduce your episode guest is to tell your audience about their background, how you know them, and why you invited them to your podcast. It will pique the listener’s interest, and they will tune in to learn more. Now that you recognize what elements to pay attention to if you want to create a killer podcast intro.</p><p>Let’s look at the samples of some of the most popular podcast intros.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Effective-podcast-introduction-examples-1"><a href="#Part-5-Effective-podcast-introduction-examples-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

So in this article, we are going to take a look closer look at some of the best 8k cameras you can find on the market in 2024 and see what they have to offer.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >11 Best Bridge Cameras [Ultimate Review] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="What-is-an-8K-Camera"><a href="#What-is-an-8K-Camera" class="headerlink" title="What is an 8K Camera?"></a>What is an 8K Camera?</h2><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> determines the maximum quality of pictures a video camera can capture. Each frame an 8K camera records can either have 7680 or 8192 pixels on the longer side of the frame and between 2160 and 8192 pixels on the shorter side of the frame depending on the video’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Commonly an 8K video with the standard 16:9 aspect ratio has 33.9 million pixels or a resolution of 7680x4320 pixels.</p><p>It is worth noting that the resolution of still images is different than the video resolution, as it is measured in megapixels. Technically, any camera that has more than 25 MP can capture photos that have 7680x3200 pixels, which means that models like <a class="link"   href="https://www.hasselblad.com/x1d/" >Hasselblad X1D II 50C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/eos-dslr-and-mirrorless-cameras/dslr/eos-5ds-r" >Canon EOS 5DS R <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can already take photos that have the same number of pixels like 8K videos. However, these medium format cameras cannot record videos in 8K resolution.</p><p>8K video cameras function on the same principle as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K or Full HD cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as they utilize a lens and a sensor to record images on the camera’s memory card. Currently, the size of the files 8K cameras produce is one of the major reasons why cinematographers are still reluctant to embrace them since 40 minutes of footage can take up to 2 terabytes of storage space.</p><p>The images recorded with 8K cameras can be used for live broadcasts, in cinemas or they can be displayed on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >8K television sets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Even so, 4K and Full HD videos are still the industry standard and it remains to be seen if 8K technology is going to change that.</p><h2 id="Which-Aspects-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-an-8K-Camera"><a href="#Which-Aspects-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-an-8K-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Which Aspects Should You Consider When Choosing an 8K Camera?"></a>Which Aspects Should You Consider When Choosing an 8K Camera?</h2><p><strong>How Much Is An 8K Camera?</strong></p><p>At the moment only professional cinematographers have any reason to purchase an 8K camera, as the price of the least expensive models varies between $24,000 and $50,000. To make matters worse, the difference between 4K and 8K footage is only visible on TV sets and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >monitors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that can display videos that are recorded in 8K resolution.</p><p><strong>Which parameters should consider in choosing 8K camera?</strong></p><p>During the process of selecting an 8K camera you must go through the list of features, and check which <strong>sensor</strong> the camera has, how much <strong>storage space</strong> it offers or find out its <strong>maximum</strong> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>frame rate</strong></a>. Most of the 8K camera models can capture footage at 60fps, although their <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >bit rates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can vary, which impacts the speed at which data is transferred. Furthermore, you should pay attention to the camera’s lens mount type, since you must also acquire lenses for the 8K camera you are considering.</p><p>In case you are looking for a camera, you can use for broadcasting the speed at which the camera transfers the data or its SDI output are among the most important features you should consider, while if you are searching for a camera you will be using to shoot movies you must look into features like the maximum frame rate, camera’s shutter speed or the storage capacity.</p><h2 id="Best-8K-Cameras-on-the-Market-in-2024"><a href="#Best-8K-Cameras-on-the-Market-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Best 8K Cameras on the Market in 2024"></a><strong>Best 8K Cameras on the Market in 2024</strong></h2><p>Even though 8K cameras have been on the market for the larger part of this decade, there are only a handful of models to choose from in 2024. Furthermore, most of the 8K camera models are too expensive, as it is still much more affordable to rent them than to purchase them. Here’s what some of the most prestigious camera manufacturers have to offer when it comes to 8K cameras.</p><h3 id="1-Canon"><a href="#1-Canon" class="headerlink" title="1. Canon"></a>1. Canon</h3><p>The rumors that Canon is working on its first 8K camera surfaced in early 2019, but as the year’s end approaches it is still unclear when and if the manufacturer will present its first 8K camera to the world. The Canon’s first 8K full-frame camera should have <strong>a CMOS sensor</strong> that resembles the Super 35mm sensor, although the exact specifications are still not available to the public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-5ds-r-dslr.jpg"                      alt="Canon EOS 5DS R DSLR Camera"                ></p><p>Image resource: Cannon</p><p>This camera should be capable of recording <strong>8K footage at 60 fps</strong>, as well as 4K footage at 120 fps, but whether or not this will turn out to be true still remains to be seen. However, a number of Canon’s models are already equipped with <strong>50MP</strong> sensors that can capture still images in resolutions that go as high as <strong>8712 x 5813</strong> or record videos in 4K resolution at 60fps.</p><p>Models like <a class="link"   href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/eos-dslr-and-mirrorless-cameras/dslr/eos-5ds" >EOS 5DS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Mirrorless-Digital-Camera-Body/dp/B07H484HLT" >EOS R <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, are powerful enough to enable you to take still images at resolutions that resemble those provided by 8K cameras. However, the exact date when Canon is going to unveil their first 8K camera is still not known, but if any of the rumors are true it could easily happen that we are going to see the Canon’s first 8K camera in 2020.</p><h3 id="2-Nikon"><a href="#2-Nikon" class="headerlink" title="2. Nikon"></a>2. Nikon</h3><p>Even though Nikon is one of the leading camera manufacturers in the world, there are still no 8K Nikon cameras. After Apple’s WWDC event information surfaced that Nikon is developing a new 8K model, but this information has been dismissed as false soon after the event.</p><p>At the moment the <a class="link"   href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d850.html" >Nikon D850 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the closest to an 8K camera this manufacturer has to offer since this 47.5 MP camera can record time-lapses in 8K resolution, although only by combining the footage captured with two D850 models.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nikon-d850-8k-time-lapse-camera.jpg"                      alt="Nikon D850 8K Timelapse Camera"                ></p><p>Image resource: Nikon</p><p>This Nikon’s camera has also 7fps continuous shooting mode as well as the capability to record 4K UHD videos at 30, 25 and 24 fps. Nikon D850 has an FX CMOS sensor that can capture images that have 8256 x 5504 pixels and the ISO sensitivity that ranges from ISO 64 to ISO 25,600.</p><p>The camera is compatible with G, E, and D AF Nikkor lenses as well as DX and AI-P lenses, which provides you with enough versatility to shoot virtually any scene you want. Whether or not Nikon is going to add 8K cameras to their assortment of products is not yet clear, and it may be a while until one of the largest camera manufacturers in the industry releases its first 8K camera.</p><h3 id="3-Sharp"><a href="#3-Sharp" class="headerlink" title="3. Sharp"></a>3. Sharp</h3><p>A few years ago, Sharp introduced 8C-B60A, the world’s first 8K camcorder and a few years later there are only a few cameras that have the features that can be compared to those you can find on the 8C-B60A camcorder.</p><p><strong>The Super 35mm equivalent single-plate CMOS sensor</strong> has approximately <strong>33 million pixels</strong>, while the <strong>quad-link 12G-SDI output terminal</strong> enables capturing and broadcasting footage live while the recording session is still in progress.</p><p>8C-B60A can record <strong>8K 10-bit videos at 60fps</strong>, although you can set the frame rate to 50, 30 or 24fps. The camcorder is also equipped with a <strong>2TB SSD pack</strong> that can store up to <strong>40 minutes of 8K footage</strong> and it offers the possibility to use the SDHC card for proxy recording. 8C-B60A utilizes the <strong>Grass Valley HQX Codec</strong> to compress the raw video files at a <strong>6 Gbps compression rate</strong>.</p><p>It features two <strong>AUDIO IN XLR type 3 pins</strong> and one <strong>MIC IN XLR type 5 pin</strong>. The camcorder doesn’t have batteries and it is powered through a <strong>130W 13V DC output AC&#x2F;DC adapter XLR 4-pin</strong>. The Sharp’s 8C-B60A 8K camcorder is undoubtedly one of the best 8K cameras you can buy in 2024, despite the hefty price tag.</p><h3 id="4-Sony"><a href="#4-Sony" class="headerlink" title="4. Sony"></a>4. Sony</h3><p>Professional cinematographers don’t need an introduction to Sony’s cameras, as the Japanese camera manufacturer has been at the forefront of the digital camera market for decades. Their <a class="link"   href="https://pro.sony/ue%5FUS/products/digital-cinema-cameras/f65#SATD501220TheF65Cinealta-f65" >F65 CineAlta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was released in 2016, but it is still one of the best 8K cameras you can buy in 2024. This speaks volumes about the F65’s capabilities, much like the fact that professional cinematographers have nothing but praise for this Sony’s camera model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-f65-cineAlta-8k-camera.jpg"                      alt="Sony F65 CineAlta 8K Camera"                ></p><p>Image resource: Sony</p><p>The <strong>1-chip 20MP Super 35mm type</strong> <strong>24.7mm X 13.1mm</strong> <strong>CMOS sensor</strong> enables you to capture videos in 8K, 4K or 2K resolutions. The camera’s <strong>PL lens mount</strong> is standard for all film cameras, which means that you won’t have too much trouble finding the lens you can use with F65 CineAlta.</p><p>The camera has <strong>14 stops of exposure latitude</strong>, so if you are shooting RAW video files F65 will utilize the <strong>S-Log3&#x2F;S-Gamut3 gamma curve</strong> to ensure accurate color depiction. In addition, this 8K camera can capture <strong>275,000,000,000,000 color variations</strong> even while you are shooting in full resolution at 60fps. Unsurprisingly, F65 CineAlta costs more than $60.000, but it is still a great investment for all professional filmmakers in need of a camera that can deliver great performances regardless of the available light.</p><h3 id="5-Ikegami"><a href="#5-Ikegami" class="headerlink" title="5. Ikegami"></a>5. Ikegami</h3><p>Ikegami is a well-known manufacturer of professional broadcast cameras, so it comes as no surprise that the first handheld 8K UHD Television Camera System was produced by this Japanese television equipment manufacturer. Their <a class="link"   href="https://www.ikegami.com/archives/menu1/shk-810" >SHK-810 8K Super Hi-Vision Camera System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> features a <strong>Super 35mm 33 million-pixel CMOS Sensor</strong> as well as <strong>4,000 TV lines</strong> which enables the camera to capture highly-detailed images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ikegami-8k-super-hi-vision-camera-system.jpg"                      alt="ikegami 8K Super Hi-Vision Camera System"                ></p><p>Image resource: ikegami</p><p>This broadcast camera has <strong>a PL lens mount with a back-focus adjusting mechanism</strong> that helps the camera operator to keep the image sharp even while recording rapidly moving figures and objects. The SHK-810’s output signal features are equally impressive since you can choose between <strong>SHV Dual Green SDI Interface, 4K SMPTE 424M (3G-SDI) Level B and HD SMPTE 292M</strong> options.</p><p>In addition, you can choose between <strong>2-channel x 4K and 4-channel HD</strong> return signals or opt for <strong>Tri-Level Sync</strong> or <strong>VBS</strong> external sync signals. However, SHK-810 is bulky and heavy, as it weighs 9kg or 19.6 lbs without a viewfinder which makes it difficult to use without a tripod during events that last for several hours. Moreover, the camera is aimed at large television networks rather than filmmakers and cinematographers, and at the moment Ikegami doesn’t offer any 8K camera models that are designed for filmmaking purposes.</p><h3 id="6-Red"><a href="#6-Red" class="headerlink" title="6. Red"></a>6. Red</h3><p>The list of TV shows and movies shot on RED cameras is seemingly endless and it includes some of the best movies made over the last ten years. Models like <a class="link"   href="https://www.red.com/DSMC2-BRAIN?quantity=1?sensor=1" >Monstro 8K VV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.red.com/DSMC2-BRAIN?quantity=1&sensor=2" >Helium 8K S35 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.red.com/DSMC2-MONOCHROME-BRAIN?quantity=1&sensor=2" >Helium 8K S35 Monochrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are all <strong>modular DSMC2 cameras</strong> that can be used with different types of lenses. Each of these 8K cameras has a <strong>35.4 MP CMOS sensor</strong>, however, the size of the sensor depends on the model. All RED’s 8K DSMC2 cameras can write data at <strong>300 MB&#x2F;s</strong> and they have an incredibly high dynamic range that varies from <strong>16.5+ to 17+ stops</strong>, which enables them to capture a broad spectrum of colors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-dsmc2-brain-monstro-8k-w.jpg"                      alt="Red DSMC2 BRAIN"                ></p><p>Image resource: red</p><p>Furthermore, each of the Red’s 8K cameras can record 8K videos at <strong>60fps</strong> while they also offer the possibility to capture <strong>7K, 6K, 5K or 4K</strong> videos at different frame rates. In addition, these modular cameras are equipped with the <strong>Apple ProRes codecs</strong> that ensure high image quality throughout the video recording and editing processes.</p><p>The body of an 8K Red camera can cost between <strong>$24,000 and $50,000</strong> which makes these cameras available only to professional film and TV productions. It is also worth noting that the footage captured with any of the 8K RED camera models can be edited in only a handful of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> products.</p><p>Still don’t know to choose which? Whatch this!</p><h3 id="What-Gear-Do-Creators-Actually-Use-Vidcon-2023-Sony-vs-Canon"><a href="#What-Gear-Do-Creators-Actually-Use-Vidcon-2023-Sony-vs-Canon" class="headerlink" title="What Gear Do Creators Actually Use | Vidcon 2023 | Sony vs Canon"></a>What Gear Do Creators Actually Use | Vidcon 2023 | Sony vs Canon</h3><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>2024 is going to be an exciting time to shop for a new camera, although your choices are still going to be limited if you would like to buy an 8K camera. Red, Sharp or Sony are going to continue to be the best option for cinematographers who want to shoot their footage in 8K resolution, even though it is highly unlikely that the prices of 8K cameras are going to go down in the foreseeable future.</p><p>In addition, Canon and Nikon only offer 50 MP cameras that can capture still images that have the same amount of pixels as 8K videos, but there are no indications that these manufacturers are going to release new models that can record 8K videos.

Naturally, the selection of right monitor for buyers, especially for newbie become a difficult task as there are lots of technical terms evolved around. Designs may appear impressive at first look but they may have lower feature rating so you need to stay careful while making such a big investment. It is important to add more focus to your requirements and budget while making final selection. The article below can help you to grab information about some of the major features that you need to search in your new product.</p><h2 id="Things-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-4K-Monitor"><a href="#Things-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-4K-Monitor" class="headerlink" title="Things to Consider Before Buying a 4K Monitor"></a>Things to Consider Before Buying a 4K Monitor</h2><h3 id="1-Monitor-Size"><a href="#1-Monitor-Size" class="headerlink" title="1. Monitor Size"></a>1. Monitor Size</h3><p> Bigger is always better! But you must have space for that; also it will be expensive too. Display size is usually measured diagonally on its length. Specifications are generally mentioned in terms of aspect ratio and if you have gone through algebra and geometry in any stage of your life then definitely you can calculate height and width of your display from given aspect ratio. Note that, an aspect ratio of 1:1 will result in a closer view that falls directly in the vision line but the bigger units will have higher aspect ratios.</p><h3 id="2-Monitor-Type"><a href="#2-Monitor-Type" class="headerlink" title="2. Monitor Type"></a>2. Monitor Type</h3><p> If you move towards market, you will find three terms related to monitor type and of course they can easily confuse a beginner. 4K displays are divided into three forms: TN, IGZO and IPS type. Each one of these has unique pros and cons. Here are few details:</p><p> TN Panels:</p><p> These are recommended for beginners due to simple features and affordable price range. However, you can expect them to deliver fast response time but users need to make compromises for color accuracy in images.</p><p> IPS Panels:</p><p> This selection improves performance in terms of image sharpness and color reproduction. If you are a gamer or love to do video animation then you may find it little slow for your expectations. Note that, TN displays offer response time rating of 1 millisecond whereas IPS stops at 4 millisecond level.</p><p> IGZO Panels:</p><p> IGZO panels are able to deliver high power service due to their improved transistor based design. At the same time, these panels use to have lower physical mass but they stay always ready to consume more energy with high power delivery.</p><p> While buying a new panel for your 4K needs, it is goo to check for processing power and graphic card details; but the best decision will be made on the basis of your budget.</p><h3 id="3-Color-Accuracy"><a href="#3-Color-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="3. Color Accuracy"></a>3. Color Accuracy</h3><p> Technologies are taking over each other day by day; with this advancement several features are being improved but few are also getting worst like colour gamut of new monitors as compared to the old ones. It is essential to have higher colour accuracy for 4K videos because better colours lead to decent information delivery. Monitors or PCs from several years are following standard RGB pattern for color adjustments where sRGB is considered as best for full coverage with precise color delivery; you may find Adobe RGB little complicated as its range doesn’t suit to human eye.</p><p> The term color accuracy deals with the system’s ability to deliver required level of hue instead of making rough calculations for its delivery. When color gets deviated from its actual fidelity level then this error is represented with a Delta E figure, note that it is essential to have lower value of delta E value that reflects good color delivery. The best recommendation is 1.0.</p><h3 id="4-Refresh-Rate"><a href="#4-Refresh-Rate" class="headerlink" title="4. Refresh Rate"></a>4. Refresh Rate</h3><p> It is again an important consideration for your 4k monitor buying needs. Manufacturers design monitors with variable refresh rates for variable applications; for example, the gaming monitors use to have 144Hz refresh rate, the mainstreams go little downward with 60Hz rating whereas most of the 4K displays come with 30Hz refresh rate. It becomes little difficult to deal with video and image editing needs at 30Hz because it makes window and mouse handling little complicated with slow speed but yes a 60Hz option is better for desired speed range; you can also go for higher than this.</p><h3 id="5-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#5-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="5. Aspect Ratio"></a>5. Aspect Ratio</h3><p> It is the ratio of length with respect to height of the display screen. One of the most popularly used aspect ratio setting is 16:9 that delivers great results for games and movies. In case if you are a serious hardcode gamer then you may find 21:9 aspect ratio more suitable; this range is available for few gaming special monitors. With 16:10 rating, you can enjoy more vertical space and it suits better when users need to work upon numbers of images and documents.</p><h3 id="6-Brightness"><a href="#6-Brightness" class="headerlink" title="6. Brightness"></a>6. Brightness</h3><p> Most of the high end monitors are designed to offer brightness rating somewhere around 300 or 350 cd&#x2F;m2. In case if you work in a much brighter room then you can easily handle higher brightness ranges for your monitor but note that this higher rating causes more strain to your eyes. The most suitable and professional recommended brightness range is 250 cd&#x2F;m2.</p><h3 id="7-Contrast-Ratio"><a href="#7-Contrast-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="7. Contrast Ratio"></a>7. Contrast Ratio</h3><p> It shows the different between brightest and darkest reflection on your screen. It is always advised to buy monitors that offer higher contrast ratio because this higher rating means much better differentiation between brighter and darker scenes. However, all manufacturers prefer to add different contrast ratio parameters to their products without following any standard for this rating so you cannot make more analysis for this feature.</p><h3 id="8-Response-Time"><a href="#8-Response-Time" class="headerlink" title="8. Response Time"></a>8. Response Time</h3><p> The time taken by a pixel to change its color is measured in terms of response time. Most of the old display screens used to suffer with ghost effect that occurs due to very slow response time when pixels are not able to work in synchronization with moving frames. But all the recent designs offer improvement over response time with a valuable range of 1 to 4 ms.</p><h3 id="9-Connectivity"><a href="#9-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="9. Connectivity"></a>9. Connectivity</h3><p> It is essential to take a wise decision about getting certified display cables for your monitors but few popular manufacturers these days are also offering uncertified DP cables. These uncertified cables lead to so many troubles; one of the most common is that they make connection with pin 20 and reflects unwanted voltage back to the system- causing big damage. Also, the uncertified cables lead to bandwidth losses where 4K display cannot function well even at 60Hz rating and improper cables cause reduction in refresh rates. The idea is to get a 4K monitor with 4K HDMI support but it must be supported by your graphic card as well as monitor. The USB hubs are also essential options and they offer higher speed rating too.</p><h3 id="10-Windows-Scaling"><a href="#10-Windows-Scaling" class="headerlink" title="10.Windows Scaling"></a>10.Windows Scaling</h3><p> Here is one more essential consideration for buying 4K monitors and it is named as DPI, desktop or window scaling. Generally, PCs are designed with higher pixel densities; it helps to improve size of menus and windows that enhances readability. Note that, window scaling not always effect all applications on your device so if you have few commonly used app collections in this category then you may not find it as useful.</p><h3 id="11-Viewing-Angle"><a href="#11-Viewing-Angle" class="headerlink" title="11.Viewing Angle"></a>11.Viewing Angle</h3><p> Generally, the term viewing angle is related to TV screens but in case if you want to enjoy videos on your computer with your friends around then you must have higher viewing angle setting for better results. Prefer to keep it above 170 degree.</p><h3 id="12-G-Sync-or-FreeSync"><a href="#12-G-Sync-or-FreeSync" class="headerlink" title="12.G-Sync or FreeSync"></a>12.G-Sync or FreeSync</h3><p> Gamers need to focus on these two parameters; collectively they are well known as adaptive sync. These settings improve system performance over screen tearing issue, graphic mismatch problems and refresh rate mismatches. The screen tearing problem use to affect gamers when they switch to fast paced games as monitor refresh rate cannot stay in synchronization with the output of graphic card. This effect is quite annoying but thanks to adaptive synch technology that leads to better displays with improved synchronization. Note that, you cannot find a monitor that has both FreeSync and G-Sync technology. Adaptive sync is useful for adjustment of frames and shutter speeds.</p><h2 id="Bonus-for-Great-4K-Monitor"><a href="#Bonus-for-Great-4K-Monitor" class="headerlink" title="Bonus for Great 4K Monitor"></a>Bonus for Great 4K Monitor</h2><h3 id="1-Support-Hardware-Calibration"><a href="#1-Support-Hardware-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="1. Support Hardware Calibration"></a>1. Support Hardware Calibration</h3><p> Professionals always need perfect performance from their monitors because they do not have any space for making compromises for quality. You need to make efforts for selection of finest backlights and LCD panels; prefer to run calibration tests before buying your new monitor.</p><h3 id="2-Backlight-Compensation"><a href="#2-Backlight-Compensation" class="headerlink" title="2. Backlight Compensation"></a>2. Backlight Compensation</h3><p> Many monitors these days also have backlight compensation ability that leads to adjustments of color and brightness settings of display screen. When monitors do not have backlight compensation feature then they naturally deliver much better contrast ratios. Professionals must initiate search for tone perfection to avail best results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-from-vivid-to-velvet-adobe-premiere-transitions/"><u>[New] From Vivid To Velvet  Adobe Premiere Transitions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-frame-perfect-capture-leading-slow-motion-cameras-reviewed/"><u>[New] Frame-Perfect Capture  Leading Slow Motion Cameras Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-faithful-frequencies-free-christian-music-downloads/"><u>[Updated] Faithful Frequencies  Free Christian Music Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-grip-it-right-tips-for-eliminating-jitter-in-action-cam-movies/"><u>2024 Approved  Grip It Right  Tips for Eliminating Jitter in Action Cam Movies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-from-noisy-to-neat-cutting-out-clutter-on-photos/"><u>[New] From Noisy to Neat  Cutting Out Clutter on Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-fish-tastic-top-5-action-cameras-for-catch/"><u>2024 Approved  Fish-Tastic  Top 5 Action Cameras for Catch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-excellent-5-add-ons-to-amplify-oceanic-shoots/"><u>[New] Excellent 5 Add-Ons to Amplify Oceanic Shoots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-side-by-side-hero4-vs-hero5-analysis/"><u>[New] Side by Side  Hero4 vs Hero5 Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-prime-old-school-techniques-elevating-edits-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Prime Old-School Techniques Elevating Edits for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-simplifying-scheduling-a-google-meet-pro-tip-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Simplifying Scheduling  A Google Meet Pro Tip for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/prime-8-edits-suites-on-linux-os/"><u>Prime 8 Edits Suites on Linux OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-ignite-imagination-top-inspiration-driven-youtube-content/"><u>[New] Ignite Imagination  Top Inspiration-Driven YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-upload-youtube-shorts-detailed-instructions-from-desktopmobile/"><u>[New] Upload YouTube Shorts  Detailed Instructions From Desktop/Mobile</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-google-meet-username-transformation-guide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Google Meet Username Transformation Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-the-fcpx-shortcut-bible-40-essential-commands-to-know-for-2024/"><u>New The FCPX Shortcut Bible 40 Essential Commands to Know for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-xs-max-passcode-without-computer-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock iPhone XS Max Passcode without Computer? | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Top 10 Meme Template Ideas"></a>Part 1. Top 10 Meme Template Ideas</h2><p>Social media doesn’t have to be just serious and instructive. You may also enjoy it a little bit! Adding comedy or relevant material is really a terrific strategy to engage your readers. The decade’s biggest cultural phenomena are memes. Every human phenomenon has a meme equivalent, but certain forms have shown to be more effective and durable over time than others, both in terms of narrative flexibility and the opportunity for innovative remixes. We’ve picked the top 10 meme templates below.</p><h3 id="1-Burning-Paper"><a href="#1-Burning-Paper" class="headerlink" title="1. Burning Paper"></a>1. Burning Paper</h3><p>A year without a new SpongeBob meme is nothing. In this meme, SpongeBob may be seen reading a document with some mockery before burning it without looking back. This sample only demonstrates the lack of interest some individuals have in anything.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/burning-paper.jpg"                      alt="burning paper"                ></p><h3 id="2-They-Can’t-Read"><a href="#2-They-Can’t-Read" class="headerlink" title="2. They Can’t Read"></a>2. They Can’t Read</h3><p>What more effective approach to convey a point than via a meme? Using this template, you may express a strong or unpopular stance while simultaneously making snide remarks about others who disagree with you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/they-cant-read.jpg"                      alt="they cant read"                ></p><h3 id="3-I-Am-Once-Again-Asking"><a href="#3-I-Am-Once-Again-Asking" class="headerlink" title="3. I Am Once Again Asking"></a>3. I Am Once Again Asking</h3><p>This priceless meme was lifted from one of Bernie Sanders’ campaign materials. This example just demonstrates how desperate people would do anything, no matter how humiliating. And we apologize to Bernie personally for our shortcomings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/im-once-again-asking.jpg"                      alt="im once again asking"                ></p><h3 id="4-Draw-25"><a href="#4-Draw-25" class="headerlink" title="4. Draw 25"></a>4. Draw 25</h3><p>You know that feeling you get in the game of Uno when you just have one card and simply can’t seem to obtain the card you need, so you keep drawing? This example only demonstrates the fact that certain choices aren’t worthwhile at any price.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/draw-25.jpg"                      alt="draw 25"                ></p><h3 id="5-I-Pretend-I-Do-Not-See-It"><a href="#5-I-Pretend-I-Do-Not-See-It" class="headerlink" title="5. I Pretend I Do Not See It"></a>5. I Pretend I Do Not See It</h3><p>I Pretend I Do Not See It is another one on the list. There are times when we just do not want to see things, especially when they are complete and total disappointments, like the year 2020. We have elected to become blind because we are too exhausted, and I believe I can speak for everyone when I say that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/pretend-dont-see-it.jpg"                      alt="pretend dont see it"                ></p><h3 id="6-Gossip-Girl"><a href="#6-Gossip-Girl" class="headerlink" title="6. Gossip Girl"></a>6. Gossip Girl</h3><p>This Gossip Girl-inspired meme template combines some intriguing questions with the show’s logo’s writing to create a humorous whole. This meme style consistently entertains, regardless of whether the comedy is in the question or the answer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gossip-girl.jpg"                      alt="gossip girl"                ></p><h3 id="7-Return-To-Monke"><a href="#7-Return-To-Monke" class="headerlink" title="7. Return To Monke"></a>7. Return To Monke</h3><p>If we were all monkeys, this epidemic would not have occurred. Absolutely, I say. Because of this, I and a vast majority of people think that we need to abandon a million years of development and go back to being monks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/return-to-monke.jpg"                      alt="return to monke"                ></p><h3 id="8-They-Don’t-Know"><a href="#8-They-Don’t-Know" class="headerlink" title="8. They Don’t Know"></a>8. They Don’t Know</h3><p>When you’re at a party and people don’t realize how much superior you are to them, isn’t that upsetting? Everyone believes that it’s okay, and this meme is proof of that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/they-dont-know.jpg"                      alt="they dont know"                ></p><h3 id="9-How-It-Started"><a href="#9-How-It-Started" class="headerlink" title="9.

Top 10 Meme Template Ideas<p>Social media doesn’t have to be just serious and instructive. You may also enjoy it a little bit! Adding comedy or relevant material is really a terrific strategy to engage your readers. The decade’s biggest cultural phenomena are memes. Every human phenomenon has a meme equivalent, but certain forms have shown to be more effective and durable over time than others, both in terms of narrative flexibility and the opportunity for innovative remixes. We’ve picked the top 10 meme templates below.</p><h3 id="1-Burning-Paper-1"><a href="#1-Burning-Paper-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Burning Paper"></a>1. Burning Paper</h3><p>A year without a new SpongeBob meme is nothing. In this meme, SpongeBob may be seen reading a document with some mockery before burning it without looking back. This sample only demonstrates the lack of interest some individuals have in anything.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/burning-paper.jpg"                      alt="burning paper"                ></p><h3 id="2-They-Can’t-Read-1"><a href="#2-They-Can’t-Read-1" class="headerlink" title="2. They Can’t Read"></a>2. They Can’t Read</h3><p>What more effective approach to convey a point than via a meme? Using this template, you may express a strong or unpopular stance while simultaneously making snide remarks about others who disagree with you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/they-cant-read.jpg"                      alt="they cant read"                ></p><h3 id="3-I-Am-Once-Again-Asking-1"><a href="#3-I-Am-Once-Again-Asking-1" class="headerlink" title="3. I Am Once Again Asking"></a>3. I Am Once Again Asking</h3><p>This priceless meme was lifted from one of Bernie Sanders’ campaign materials. This example just demonstrates how desperate people would do anything, no matter how humiliating. And we apologize to Bernie personally for our shortcomings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/im-once-again-asking.jpg"                      alt="im once again asking"                ></p><h3 id="4-Draw-25-1"><a href="#4-Draw-25-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Draw 25"></a>4. Draw 25</h3><p>You know that feeling you get in the game of Uno when you just have one card and simply can’t seem to obtain the card you need, so you keep drawing? This example only demonstrates the fact that certain choices aren’t worthwhile at any price.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/draw-25.jpg"                      alt="draw 25"                ></p><h3 id="5-I-Pretend-I-Do-Not-See-It-1"><a href="#5-I-Pretend-I-Do-Not-See-It-1" class="headerlink" title="5. I Pretend I Do Not See It"></a>5. I Pretend I Do Not See It</h3><p>I Pretend I Do Not See It is another one on the list. There are times when we just do not want to see things, especially when they are complete and total disappointments, like the year 2020. We have elected to become blind because we are too exhausted, and I believe I can speak for everyone when I say that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/pretend-dont-see-it.jpg"                      alt="pretend dont see it"                ></p><h3 id="6-Gossip-Girl-1"><a href="#6-Gossip-Girl-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Gossip Girl"></a>6. Gossip Girl</h3><p>This Gossip Girl-inspired meme template combines some intriguing questions with the show’s logo’s writing to create a humorous whole. This meme style consistently entertains, regardless of whether the comedy is in the question or the answer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gossip-girl.jpg"                      alt="gossip girl"                ></p><h3 id="7-Return-To-Monke-1"><a href="#7-Return-To-Monke-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Return To Monke"></a>7. Return To Monke</h3><p>If we were all monkeys, this epidemic would not have occurred. Absolutely, I say. Because of this, I and a vast majority of people think that we need to abandon a million years of development and go back to being monks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/return-to-monke.jpg"                      alt="return to monke"                ></p><h3 id="8-They-Don’t-Know-1"><a href="#8-They-Don’t-Know-1" class="headerlink" title="8. They Don’t Know"></a>8. They Don’t Know</h3><p>When you’re at a party and people don’t realize how much superior you are to them, isn’t that upsetting? Everyone believes that it’s okay, and this meme is proof of that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/they-dont-know.jpg"                      alt="they dont know"                ></p><h3 id="9-How-It-Started-1"><a href="#9-How-It-Started-1" class="headerlink" title="9. How It Started"></a>9. How It Started</h3><p>In a year when everything remained same at all times, we were certainly preoccupied with looking for signs of advancement. Unfortunately, a lot of the time it felt like things were just getting worse.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-it-started.jpg"                      alt="how it started"                ></p><h3 id="10-Doge-vs-Cheems-1"><a href="#10-Doge-vs-Cheems-1" class="headerlink" title="10.

For those individuals or canines, who don’t, they may wish to begin soon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/doge-vs-cheems.jpg"                      alt="doge vs cheems"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-Your-Own-Meme-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-Your-Own-Meme-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Standing for High Dynamic Range, the HDR technology is designed to improve the overall color as well as the content that appears on the screen thus offering them more depth. So, if you too want to enjoy bright and vibrant colors and high-quality content while watching videos, playing games, using apps, and others on your Windows PC, this article will be of great use to you.</p><p>Learn all about Windows HD color, <strong>Windows HDR settings</strong>, how to watch HDR videos, and also how to edit them on your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/windows-hd-color-find-out-how-to-watch-and-edit-hdr-vidoes-on-your-pc-7.jpg"                      alt="hdr video"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Windows-HD-Color"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Windows-HD-Color" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Windows HD Color?"></a>Part 1: What is Windows HD Color?</h2><p>Windows HD Color is the feature that comes in the latest Windows 10 system that supports HDR content on the PC. The improved hardware will now let you enjoy the HDR content in a hassle-free manner.</p><p>With HDR content you get a wider range of colors as well as brightness that further helps in bringing out the details between the extremes. The traditional content which is also termed Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content majorly shows either the details of the bright part of the darker part but not both of them at a time. Contrary to this, the HDR content is capable of enhancing both the light as well as the dark scenes while preserving the details and producing the true colors.</p><p>For instance, in SDR content you would miss seeing the details of a building texture on a sunny day while in HDR content, you would not miss these details. So, it can be said that with HDR, the white will appear whiter and the black will appear blacker adding more depth and detail to the content.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-do-I-Watch-HDR-video-in-Windows"><a href="#Part-2-How-do-I-Watch-HDR-video-in-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How do I Watch HDR video in Windows?"></a>Part 2: How do I Watch HDR video in Windows?</h2><p>To watch HDR content on your Windows system the PC, display, and all other connected devices need to be HDR compatible. Below we have listed the requirements for watching HDR content on a PC.</p><p><strong>HDR compatible Monitor or a TV</strong></p><p>The very first requirement for you to enjoy the HDR content is a compatible display device which can be a monitor or a connected TV. So, ensure that your device is Displayed 1000 or Display HDR1600 for the HDR content to play. The HDR10 displays will not work here as they are capable of only accepting the HDR signals but cannot produce HDR content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/windows-hd-color-find-out-how-to-watch-and-edit-hdr-vidoes-on-your-pc-6.jpg"                      alt="hdr compatible monitor"                ></p><p><strong>Graphics Chip that is HDR capable</strong></p><p>An HDR-capable GPU will be required for communicating with the display. For quality content, it is recommended to use the higher-end cards that are capable of offering better output settings. You can use Nvidia GTX 950 or the later ones or AMDs Radeon R9 380 or the later ones. For the users having Intel graphics, go with the 7th Gen Kaby Lake CPU or the later versions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/windows-hd-color-find-out-how-to-watch-and-edit-hdr-vidoes-on-your-pc-1.jpg"                      alt="hdr compatible chips"                ></p><p><strong>Updated system</strong></p><p>Ensure to use the latest version of the Windows system – Windows 10 for watching high-quality HDR content seamlessly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/windows-hd-color-find-out-how-to-watch-and-edit-hdr-vidoes-on-your-pc-3.jpg"                      alt="latest system"                ></p><p><strong>Good quality DisplayPort Cable or HDMI</strong></p><p>Though the present data HDMI cables are capable of carrying the 4K signals for HDR content to perform well we suggest using a Premium High Speed or 18Gbps one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/windows-hd-color-find-out-how-to-watch-and-edit-hdr-vidoes-on-your-pc-8.jpg"                      alt="hdr compatible hdmi cable"                ></p><p><strong>HDR Contents</strong></p><p>Last but not least, the most important necessary is HDR content. No point in having all the devices and cables, if you do not have the HDR content to play on it.

If they provide quality services, they will have some of their full videos on their website. Watch at least a couple of their full videos will ensure that their video skills are quality.

A freelance website works to connect people that aren’t looking for permanent hire or short-term business, most likely on some event like weddings. People who work on freelance websites will upload their portfolio and wait for someone like you who needs their services to come along. These most freelancers are college students who studying something about videography or photography. Sometimes the freelancers are those who don’t have a company yet or are just starting out in business but they are good in covered such events, you can always ask for proof like, shorts video or a copy of some photos.
