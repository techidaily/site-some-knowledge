AZW3 called Amazon Kindle Format 8 (KF8) is a relatively new format and well supported by Kindle Paperwhite. But sometimes Kindle 5 and some third-party reading apps are unable to identify the azw3 format perfectly. Apparently Amazon also doesn’t accept azw3 files delivered via e-mail, there’re only two ways to push it to your Kindle, one is converting azw3 to mobi, the other, is via USB cable. Just because the mobi format is already widely supported, it’s very necessary to convert a azw3 file to a mobi file for reading convenient on old Kindles.

**[Ultimate Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)** will be used in the following conversion process. If the eBook is downloaded on the e-Ink Kindle, it’s usually with DRM, you will have to firstly complete the step of removing DRM.

### Remove DRM from Kindle AZW3 files

1 Make sure the eBook is purchased by your Amazon account.

2 Download, install, and run **Ultimate Converter** on your computer.

3 On account of the eBook comes from your Kindle device, the device’s serial number is required for decrypting the eBook.

**Update:** Epubor Ultimate now supports Kindles recognization. This means after you connect your Kindle to your computer, it will automatically detect your device and read all the books that saved in your device. No need to input KSN any longer!

4 Add .azw3 eBooks what you want to remove and you’re greeted with a request to enter your device’s serial number. After that, enable the OK button and the decrypting process is started automatically.

(2) Remove space character and case sensitive.
