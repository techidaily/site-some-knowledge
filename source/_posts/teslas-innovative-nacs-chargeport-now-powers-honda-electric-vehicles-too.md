## Tesla's Innovative NACS Chargeport Now Powers Honda Electric Vehicles Too

If there's a need for standardizing charging ports on all of our tech, there's even more of a need to do so with electric vehicles. With charging ports for electric cars being all over the place, it can be challenging to find an appropriate charging station for your electric vehicle down the road. And if you can't find one, and your car is running low on battery, then you might actually be in trouble. Luckily, one more car maker is joining the standardized ports club: [Honda](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-webinar-recording-techniques-for-2024/).

 Honda has announced that it will be adopting the North American Charging Standard, or NACS, starting in 2025\. [The NACS standard](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-track-imei-number-of-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-through-google-earth-by-drfone-android/) is, basically, Tesla's charging port design, which the company made into an open standard last year. Tesla charging stations are among the most widely available nationwide, and the adoption of the charging port by more car makers not only means that electric cars will become more enticing to buy, but also that NACS cars will be able to use Tesla Superchargers.

 Ford, Volvo, Rivian, GM, and Mercedez-Benz have also promised to adopt NACS in their electric vehicles, so Honda is just the latest in a long list. There are still some notable holdouts, such as Volkswagen and Toyota, but if things keep going the way they're going now, non-NACS cars will eventually become the exception rather than the norm. Even those who have already signed up to use NACS aren't immediately releasing NACS cars â€” most car makers [are expecting to adopt NACS fully by 2025](https://www.thedrive.com/guides-and-gear/which-cars-nacs-charge-plugs), and many of them, such as Ford and GM, are also planning to release adapters to make the transition easier.

 Honda models launched in North America from 2025 onwards will ship with this charging port design. It was already known that Honda was going to adopt it, but we weren't given a concrete timeframe until now. The very first NACS model from Honda should be launched in 2025, and presumably, all EV models released from that point onward will have a NACS port.

 NACS cars are still a while away, but it's nice to see so many car makers committed to standardization.
