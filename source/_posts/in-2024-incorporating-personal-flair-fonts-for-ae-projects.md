## Part 1\. How to add fonts to After Effects?

Adding fonts to any video editor is a crucial part because texts add a story to the video projects. They have a great impact on the cinematic quality of any video. For informative videos, the style of font decides the tone in which the texts are displayed.

In the After Effects application, there are different fonts available for the users to load and use in any video.

## Part 2\. Types of Fonts in After Effects

Adobe After Effects provides a ton of families of fonts that can be added and used in video projects.

Some of the most famous fonts such as "typewriter", "Cursive Handwriting" and many more are categorized under their family of fonts and are very easy to access. Along with this, you can also select fonts with different character strokes and can alter their features while adding to your videos.

## Part 3\. How to use text effects in After Effects?
