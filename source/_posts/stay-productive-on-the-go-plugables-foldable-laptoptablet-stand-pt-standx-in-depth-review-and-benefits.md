## Stay Productive on the Go: Plugable's Foldable Laptop/Tablet Stand (PT-STANDX) – In-Depth Review and Benefits

### Key Takeaways

* Portable and lightweight, the stand is perfect for travel due to its compact size.
* The stand supports laptops up to 16 inches but struggles with certain models.
* It has an affordable price of $25 but lacks storage pockets and stability for laptops.

 The [Plugable PT-STANDX Foldable Tablet and Laptop Stand](https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Foldable-Adjustable-Tablets-PT-STANDX/dp/B0CNTVXW48?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002501&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fplugable-pt-standx-foldable-tablet-and-laptop-stand-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) isn’t a complicated accessory, but I had a few struggles with some of its most basic functions that give me some pause from a blanket recommendation. Still, it’s going to be tough to find a portable stand that’s priced as low as this model.

##  Design: An Ultra-Portable Travel Stand

![The Plugable PT-STANDX Foldable Stand folded up](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/the-plugable-pt-standx-foldable-stand-folded-up-1jpg_53543617076_o-1.jpg)

 Billed as “the traveler’s dream,” the Plugable PT-STANDX doesn’t look like much outside of the box. Folded up, it looks like your average restaurant money-grabber, and it looks like a big mouse pad when it’s unfolded. If you’re always traveling, the PT-STANDX can be tossed into just about any bag, without taking up too much space. Not only is it ultra-portable, but it’s extremely lightweight, too. Considering there’s still room for a small pocket or two (for storing accessories like wires and thumb drives) when the stand is folded up, I do wish that Plugable would have included a storage compartment.

 To mount a laptop or tablet onto the PT-STANDX, you just need to unfold it, lift it from the top of the stand, and push back on the hinged piece to select a viewing angle.

 These four positions (25, 30, 45, and 60 degrees) are achieved by inserting the bottom flap of the hinge into one of the four notches on the bottom of the stand.

 I wasn’t able to track down any official materials, but it seems like the case is a combination of dark silicone padding and a black plastic outer shell. While Plugable claims the PT-STANDX is tough as nails, I’ve owned products that use similar materials, and over time, they’ve become chipped and weatherworn.

##  Compatibility: Use Caution

 The PT-STANDX is engineered to handle laptops and tablets up to 11 pounds, and 7 to 16 inches screen sizes. I own a late 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro, which only weighs three pounds. Whenever I tried to change my laptop's viewing angle when it was already mounted to the PT-STANDX, the stand would start to collapse. It wasn't a big deal to have to remove my laptop, pick a new viewing angle, and then put my MacBook back, but it was still inconvenient.

 Considering the PT-STANDX reacted so violently when just a three-pound laptop was moved, I’d be worried about putting anything heavier on the stand. That same collapsing behavior also happened when I placed my girlfriend’s iPad (9th Gen) on the PT-STANDX.

 I understand the notch-locking system that allows you to make these display adjustments, but I thought it was cheap that Plugable didn’t include locking mechanisms for each position.

 The folding mechanism can handle a decent amount of force though. I could never press down on the mechanism to make it pop out of place, and it was easy to lift and reposition (with no laptop or tablet mounted) when I wanted to choose a new angle.

##  Competition: A Dime a Dozen

 When it comes to portable laptop and tablet stands, the PT-STANDX is one of many products vying for your attention. How-To Geek has a roundup that covers all the [best laptop stands](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-oppo-reno-9a-to-other-android-devices-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/). Comparing the PT-STANDX to the best of that batch, it wins big for portability but is beaten in other categories.

 If I'm going to mount my laptop on top of a stand, I'd go with the [ElfAnt Laptop Stand](https://www.amazon.com/ElfAnt-Laptop-Adjustable-Portable-Aluminum/dp/B086L35VML/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002501&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fplugable-pt-standx-foldable-tablet-and-laptop-stand-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority). It’s designed to handle most models up to 17 inches and includes six viewing positions. The locking notches for each position are also much deeper. Then there are models like the [Havit HV-F2056](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G3YGDJ1/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002501&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fplugable-pt-standx-foldable-tablet-and-laptop-stand-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority), designed for top-shelf heat dissipation.

 Price-wise, it’s definitely hard to beat the $25 cost of the PT-STANDX, but more advanced laptop and tablet stands won’t cost much more.

##  Should You Buy the Plugable PT-STANDX?

 The [Plugable PT-STANDX Foldable Tablet and Laptop Stand](https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Foldable-Adjustable-Tablets-PT-STANDX/dp/B0CNTVXW48/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002501&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fplugable-pt-standx-foldable-tablet-and-laptop-stand-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is a decent accessory for a few applications. I can see it being very convenient to travel with, but I think it’s best used for small to mid-sized tablets. If you want it to mount your laptop, I’d advise against the purchase.
