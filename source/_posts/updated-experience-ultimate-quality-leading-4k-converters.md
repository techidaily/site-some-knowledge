## Experience Ultimate Quality: Leading 4K Converters

Though YouTube allows uploading 4K videos, the files being high in quality and large in size takes a lot of time in getting uploaded. Moreover, while uploading a 4K video, you need to adhere to the file parameters like frame rate, bit rate, and container as recommended by YouTube.

In order to overcome all these issues and others related to 4K uploading, the best solution is to downscale the video to the highest quality. To get this conversion done, you would need a good PC or an online tool. For your convenience, we have shortlisted the best tools for downscaling 4K YouTube videos and they are discussed in the following parts of the topic.

## Part 1: Is a 4K video necessary for YouTube?

Though 4K video is supported by YouTube, these are not at all necessary for YouTube. In fact, uploading a 4K video is more of a hassle as it not only takes a lot of time but needs to adhere to the set file parameters. Moreover, these 4K videos are cumbersome to edit and also, and they are not supported by a wide range of media players and devices. The large size of the 4K videos also prevents them from being shared over email and other platforms.

Considering all these factors, downscaling 4K videos to 1080p/HD is the best solution as this will not hamper the video quality and will also make the uploading, editing, and playback easy.
