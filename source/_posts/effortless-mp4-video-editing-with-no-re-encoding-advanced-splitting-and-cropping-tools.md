 The task can be done losslessly and very fast if you use an excellent MP4 cutter. Well, an outstanding video cutter is generally quicker and easier to use for any of these basic MP4 video editing tasks:   
[**Splitting**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) — to cut MP4 video files into smaller pieces so as to extract or copy specific scenes or to upload to the Internet (to YouTube, for example). Each of the split files can be played back.  
**Trimming** — to cut out unwanted sections, such as ads in a TV recording.  
**Joining** — to [join MP4 files](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) together. This only works when the video files have a similar format (same resolution, bitrate, etc). If you have ever downloaded a long video in smaller parts (such as video01.mp4, video02.mp4, video03.mp4), a joiner will put the pieces back together again in no time. 

Here we are going to share two programs -Professional **MP4 cutter**  and convenient **online editor**.
