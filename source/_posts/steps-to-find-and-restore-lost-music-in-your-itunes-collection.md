_"I just tried to change the file location of my iTunes Library, but now my iTunes app doesn't show any of my downloaded songs. Also, some of the songs that I added to my Apple Music library are no longer in my library (even not downloaded). Is there a way to sync all of my songs with the file I have my songs in? I was hoping that going in to preferences and changing the file location would take care of this for me, but it didn't. Any help? Thanks" - addy2h from Apple Discussion_

This is because the music file associated with the iTunes track you're trying to play has been moved or deleted from the original place. For that, you have 3 ways to get rid of iTunes library missing files.
