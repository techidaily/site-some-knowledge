## Part 4\. Imgur Alternative for Computer

If for some reason you are unable to use Imgur on your device, or you want to use any other efficient meme generator for creating meme videos, then Filmora is an excellent choice for that. [Filmora]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editor/) is a video editing platform that has tools to crop, split, and edit videos by adding texts and music and then exporting them as memes. Most of the amazing features from Filmora come with a paid subscription. However, it is also available for a free trial for users who want to access it on the go. And the free tools available are effective enough to create high-resolution meme videos. Below is the stepwise process following which you can edit and create meme videos on your own:

![imgur alternative for computer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-titles-win-2.png)

* To make a video meme with the help of Filmora, first, go to the application interface. Now, click on the "+" sign to add media files to your project.
* Then select the video file or video meme template that you want to edit. Now, [Filmora]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editor/) will import it to its interface. You can either select one single file from your camera roll. You can also add multiple images or videos to make a meme.
* Now after the video files are loaded into the interface, add on the "Effects" tab and then select "Texts" to add text to your meme video. Drag the timeline to the bottom of your screen to place the text where you want it to start. You can also pan or zoom the text available on your preview window. This is to adjust its placement on the final video.
* After you are done with the text editing for your meme video, you can add music and voice effects through the "Effects" option and then select "Music" from the available tools.
* After you are done with all the editing, click on the "export to device". The video will be saved to your memory drives in a few moments. Then you can share your meme to any social media handles that you prefer.
