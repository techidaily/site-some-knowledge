![Handbrake won't rip whole movie DVD](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/handbrake-dvd-zh-1.jpg)

**Solution 1**: Handbrake can't read DVDs with DRM protections itself. It requires a third-party library named libdvdcss to remove copy protections. Learn [how to install libdvdcss for Handbrake to rip protected DVDs](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). 

**Solution 2:** The possible cause is that Handbrake selects the wrong title (it also works to solve Handbrake problem with 99 titles or Handbrake finds no title error). The Handbrake troubleshooting can be very simple: tell Handbrake the right title. 

Play the DVD movie in DVD player. Go to the DVD Player's Go menu and find which title is checked. Then rip the DVD with Handbrake as the same and check the title you find from the DVD player. 

But sometimes, the DVD may have different titles, which result in Handbrake only rips part of DVD not the entire movie. To check the right titles using DVD player can be confused and frustrated, so you may need a [Handbrake alternative](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to solve the problem.

![Handbrake not converting entire movie on macOS](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/handbrake-dvd-zh-2.jpg)

**Solution**: This is because that the new security system of El Capitan "System Integrity Protection" removes some apps including [libdvdcss](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) which is required by Handbrake to rip copy-protected DVDs. So you may disable SIP and reinstall libdvdcss: 

a. Create a new Finder window.  
b. Use cmd-shift-G to go to /Library/SystemMigration/History/ and manually proceed on inside Migration-some-gibberish/QuarantineRoot/usr. Copy the libdvdcss.2.dylib file (Cmd-C).  
c. Use cmd-shift-G to /usr/local/lib and use cmd-opt-V to move it to this location.

 Another Handbrake troubleshooting is just install a copy of libdvdcss via homebrew. After reinstall the libdvdcss file, the [Handbrake DVD ripping](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) problem on El Capitan should be solved.
