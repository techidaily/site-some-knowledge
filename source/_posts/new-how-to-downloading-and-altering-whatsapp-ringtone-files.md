If your taste doesn’t match the available **WhatsApp ringtones** on the sites mentioned above, here’s a handy way to create personalized WhatsApp tones using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Filmora is a user-friendly video editor. You can easily detach the audio from the video clip and customize your own ringtone.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 In the first step, open a browser on your PC, head over to **Wondershare Filmora’s** site, and download the latest software version. Next, launch the software and click **“Import”** on the main dashboard and add two keen WhatsApp video songs to make a personalized **WhatsApp ringtone**.

Step2 Drag the keen video songs to the **“Timeline Panel”** at the bottom. Now, right-click the songs and select **“Detach Audio”** to extract Keen WhatsApp audio from videos. The audio files will then automatically show on the audio track.
