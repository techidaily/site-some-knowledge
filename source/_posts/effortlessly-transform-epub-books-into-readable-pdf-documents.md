If you want to know the differences between ePub and PDF, and why we should convert ePub to PDF, read them below.

[Or, you can just **skip to Convert EPUB to PDF** directly.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) 

### First, talk about the differences between EPUB and PDF

Both EPUB and PDF are of the most common eBook formats, and nearly all of the mainstream stores sell books in these 2 formats. But there are some differences between them which make them unique.![differences between epub and pdf](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/differences-between-epub-and-pdf.jpg)

**EPUB,** Electronic Publication, is similar to a web page. It's reflowable and the text is resizable, which allows files to be read even in devices that with a small screen. The publishing industry has adapted it as a standard format for eBooks, so EPUB is compatible with most electronic reading devices.

**PDF,** Portable Document Format, is an open standard format made by Adobe. But unlike EPUB, PDF files preserve the original layout of any documents, not allowed to edit or resize. We can even say that PDF is a default format for static documents. It can be shared easily and be printed in the original layout.

* PDF preserves original layout but EPUB doesn't.
* PDF files can be viewed on Kindle devices, but EPUB can't.
* PDF can be printed with a fixed layout, while EPUB allows text to be resizable.
* PDF is almost like a photocopy of the original content, while EPUB is almost like a webpage.
* PDF is widely used on those books that containing lots of images, charts, and also more often used for business and education.
* PDF is not only an open standard for eBooks, but also an old standard for sharing electronic documents. While EPUB is just the standard format of eBooks.

### Then, why convert ePub to PDF

Depending on the different points, the reasons why so many people choose to convert epub to pdf become easy to understand, yes?

Do you prefer to converting EPUB to PDF for the below reasons?

_Firstly_, if you want to read EPUB, you have to use a reading device, or install an EPUB reader. But for PDF files, you can even view them online with a browser like Chrome. So we can enjoy files with large-screen on our computer. Updated 2019: _I guess now most of the browser also support the epub reading._

_Secondly_, maybe there are some books that you want to share with your friends and preserve the original contents, not allowing to be modified. So converting them to PDF is a good resolution.

_Thirdly_, PDF files can be printed fast and effortlessly. It can be saved as other formats and conveyed to others by email.

_What's more_, you can convert EPUB to PDF for Kindle! If you have gathered some EPUB books, and you want to read them on your Kindle, then there is no other ways unless you converting them to PDF. (PDF is supported on Kindle).

### So, how to convert EPUB to PDF easily

**Note:** Methods introduced here don't support converting Apple ePub to PDF.

#### The problem in converting EPUB to PDF -- DRM protection![epub drm](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/epub-drm.png)

Many ebook sellers sell books that will only work on their own devices and apps, including the EPUB format files. EPUB books you purchased from stores such as Google, B&N, Kobo, Sony, and so on, are usually with DRM protection. And just because of the DRM limitation, we can't convert them to other formats or open them with other reader apps or read them on non-supported devices.

So if you have purchased a lot of epub books with DRM, you cannot convert epub to any other format before you remove the DRM. So before you start convert epub to pdf, please remove DRM from Epub books at first.

By searching the internet "how to convert EPUB to PDF", you may get many suggestions of converting EPUB to PDF, among which are common solutions are:  
 Online converter; free software (calibre); converter tool shareware. Each method has its own features, pros and cons.

The Free trial does not work. As I understand the whole point of this article was not to help people, but make them pay for your product. Very disappointing...

While converting in epubor Ultimate 3.0.12 from azw or epub to pdf, letter size is too small.  
 Is there any way to control the size of the text or the margin without changing the size of the page?

 Thank you.

Thank you for using our software. To convert the epub to pdf, Epubor ulitmate only allows you to change the paper size, not the text size. We are sincerely sorry for this issue.   
 If you like, you can just install Wordmate(windows version only), and then import the drm-free epub to it for changing the size and then export it as the PDF without page size changing.  
 Wordmate&gt;&gt;https://www.epubor.com/ebook-editor.html  
 Any more problem, please feel free to contact us via support@epubor.com
