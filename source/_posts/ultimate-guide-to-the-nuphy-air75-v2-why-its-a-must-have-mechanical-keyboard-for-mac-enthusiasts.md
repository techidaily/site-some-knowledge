##  Price and Availability

 The Nuphy Air75 V2 is available direct from Nuphy starting at $119.95 with a set of standard Gateron low-profile switches, or $129.95 with a set of Nuphy x Gateron custom low-profile switches. You can find the keyboard on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/nuphy-Air75-V2-Mechanical-Grey-Gateron/dp/B0CMYYM2SQ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003600&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fnuphy-air75-v2-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) for $139.95 and $149.95 respectively, depending on your switch choice.

 You can combine colors and switch choices, with white, black, and grey color schemes available. There’s also the NuFolio V3 carrying case available in two colors (tan and gray) for an additional $29\. The case doubles up as both a carrying case and tablet stand, which is ideal if you want that mechanical typing experience on the go.

 The keyboard I tested is the Air75 V2 with tactile Moss switches, in Ionic White. In addition to Gateron Red, Brown, and Blue switches you also get a choice of custom linear (Cowberry and Aloe) and another tactile (Wisteria) switch.

##  Air75 Version 2 Improvements

 If you’re coming from the original Air75, there are a few improvements to note in V2\. The revised version makes use of a higher 1000Hz polling rate when connected via Bluetooth, supports QMK/VIA customization, and ships with double-shot PBT keycaps that shouldn't get shiny over time.

 V2 also has a greater choice of Nuphy x Gateron switches, is available in two more colors, has brighter RGB backlighting, and offers improved acoustics thanks to new sound dampening inside the keyboard.

 There’s no reason to pick the original over the revision, except for perhaps a massive discount. Even then, these improvements seem worth it for anyone looking for a premium yet portable low-profile keyboard.

##  An Apple User’s Take on the Air75 V2

 Let me preface this review by stating that I am not an expert on mechanical keyboards. This is the first mechanical keyboard that I’ve owned outright. As a Mac user for the past few decades, I’ve become accustomed to Apple’s ultra-low-profile keyboards, and I’ve been daily driving a 16-inch 2021 MacBook Pro since it launched.

 My hope for the Air75 V2 was to find a more satisfying, interesting, and customizable typing experience. After using the keyboard for a week to do everything from editing text to writing thousands of words in a single sitting, I think I’ve achieved my goal. I’m also still unsure if I’ll be using the keyboard full-time going forward.

 A low-profile keyboard makes sense for someone who has grown accustomed to essentially typing on a flat surface. The Air75 V2 feels great in this regard, with adjustable legs that allow you to type at three angles. I didn’t feel the need for a wrist rest while using the keyboard, and the difference in height between my Magic Trackpad and the keyboard wasn’t an issue.

![A NuPhy Air75 V2 next to a Magic Trackpad and a MacBook Pro.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/keyboard_trackpad.jpg) 

Tim Brookes / How-To Geek

 The Air75 V2 is a 75% keyboard that’s ever-so-slightly larger than the MacBook Pro keyboard I’m used to, but one that shares a similar layout with a full row of function keys. It works seamlessly with macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, and more thanks to wireless connections via Bluetooth and the included 2.4GHz dongle, plus a wired connection over the included USB-C to USB-A cable.

 The keyboard includes four Bluetooth profiles, making it easy to switch between devices using the “Fn” and number keys. Bluetooth has a satisfactory polling rate of 125Hz. I haven’t noticed any lag when typing or editing text but gamers might want to opt for the 2.4GHz connection that polls at 1000Hz or a wire to reduce latency to around 1ms.

 There are switches on the back for moving between wireless and wired, Windows and Mac. You also get a selection of replaceable keycaps for going all-Windows and all-Mac, plus a charming “Cat” key which I immediately replaced with the “Del” key. Nuphy includes a keycap puller and switch remover tool, plus one each of the Wisteria, Moss, Aloe, and Cowberry custom switches.

 Some of the more interesting keys (from a Mac perspective) include a dedicated screenshot key which works on both Mac and Windows, the aforementioned “Del” key that is usually missing on the reduced Mac keyboard, and an Fn key that doesn’t trigger the macOS language or emoji picker like its Apple counterpart. Instead, the Fn key is used to change keyboard settings like lighting, auto-sleep mode, and so on.

 In terms of size, 75% feels perfect for someone who appreciates the tidy look of a small keyboard that doesn’t skimp on the essentials.

##  Typing Speed Isn’t Everything

 For me, the most striking thing about this keyboard (and likely any decent mechanical keyboard) is how satisfying the experience is. This isn’t the most premium-sounding keyboard, but it still sounds better than the tinny Apple experience I’m used to. The Moss switches require slightly less pressure than I’m used to on a Magic Keyboard, but travel significantly further.

 That means that the Air75 V2 feels like a workout for the hands in comparison. This is something I noticed right away, and something that hasn’t really changed in the week or so I’ve been using it. It’s the price you pay to feel like you’re _really_ hitting those keys, but it has some perhaps unwanted side effects.

 I’m still faster on a Magic Keyboard. Within an hour or two of unboxing the Air75 V2, I’d improved by around 15 words per minute, but I’m around 15 to 25 words per minute faster on Apple’s keyboard. That said, speed isn’t everything. So what about accuracy?

 This is hard to gauge as an objective metric, so I’m not going to bother. I've made way more mistakes on this keyboard compared to the Magic Keyboard, mostly on the right side of the keyboard. The right “Shift” key is smaller than I’m used to, and the “Backslash” is a lot bigger. Navigating text with a slightly adjusted arrow key layout also threw me.

 This is something you can overcome, but as someone who will be frequently switching between my MacBook’s built-in keyboard and the keyboard on my desk, it requires some serious patience. The truth of the matter is that muscle memory develops over time. I’m convinced now that if I stick the Air75 V2 out, I’ll get there eventually and have a more enjoyable typing experience as a result.

 Switching to a keyboard like the Air75 V2 also means making do without Touch ID. This doesn’t bother me as I’ve switched to authenticating with my Apple Watch instead (I’ve since disabled Touch ID altogether, even when I’m not using the Air75 V2).

##  A Fully Customizable Keyboard, In Theory

 There’s more to a keyboard like the Air75 V2 than simply the typing experience. The Magic Keyboard is boring by comparison when it comes to the many ways you can customize the Nuphy. This starts on the board itself, with its removable low-profile keycaps and hot-swappable switches.

 One area where the revised V2 Air75 improves on its predecessor is with VIA/QMK support. This effectively allows you to customize what every key does and create macros. Unfortunately, despite following [Nuphy’s guide](https://nuphy.com/pages/via-usage-guide-for-nuphy-keyboards) I couldn’t get this working at all on macOS, either with the native VIA app or the VIA web app.

 I tried disconnecting the keyboard, restarting my Mac, and installing different versions of Chromium-based browsers. Nothing helped. My keyboard is visible in Chrome and I can authorize the connection attempt, but every time the web app stonewalls me when attempting to configure the keyboard.

![The VIA configurator tool for macOS refusing to work.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/screenshot-2024-06-12-at-09-58-45.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 For me, this isn’t a huge deal. I didn’t pick the Air75 V2 for its firmware-level customization. That was just a nice bonus that I was looking forward to playing with. That said, Mac users hoping to dig into this stuff might want to reconsider. Ironically, Tyler had similar issues when [reviewing the Nuphy Air60 V2](https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-to-repairing-your-oculus-headsets-technical-glitches/).

 The Air75 V2 includes customizable RGB lighting too. There are 40 different RGB rainbow effects, but no see-through keycaps are included in the box. You can switch them out, but it feels like a missed opportunity. Lighting is fun but ultimately provides no function outside of looking pretty.

 For what it’s worth, the standalone Magic Keyboard doesn’t include any lighting at all.

##  Battery Life is Great (Without RGB)

 Speaking of lighting, if you’re really after the best possible battery life then you’ll want to disable these effects altogether. The Air75 V2 has a 4,000mAh battery that is rated for up to 220 hours of usage over Bluetooth with the backlight disabled.

 Turn the lighting effects on and this can drop as low as 35 hours, according to Nuphy’s numbers. I had the lighting mostly off all week and I barely noticed the battery level drop.

 Make no mistake, the Air75 V2 has one of the largest batteries in its class of low-profile mechanical keyboards. This makes it a great portable typing companion for tablet or smartphone users. The large battery helps add some heft to the board that keeps it planted on your desk, too.

##  Should You Buy the Air75 V2 Keyboard?

 Overall, the [Nuphy Air75 V2](http://nuphy.com/products/air75-v2) is probably the best choice you can make if you want a 75% low-profile mechanical keyboard that not only supports macOS but can even replace your built-in MacBook keyboard by fitting neatly over the top of it.

 It’s a worthy alternative to a Magic Keyboard. The transition is far from seamless, but if you demand more travel and better acoustics then the Nuphy ticks the boxes. Whether a keyboard like the Air75 V2 is faster and more accurate ultimately comes down to time, patience, and what you prefer when the dust has settled. There’s no easy answer here. At some point, you just have to try it and see.

Tim Brookes / How-To Geek

 In terms of alternative keyboards, the [LoFree Flow84](https://www.lofree.co/products/lofree-flow-the-smoothest-mechanical-keyboard) is arguably the closest competitor. It’s a more premium keyboard with fancier Khail switches, an all-aluminum construction, and it sounds considerably better than the Air75 V2\. It also lacks 2.4GHz connectivity, has a much smaller battery, and the Bluetooth polling rate has caused many to complain about a “laggy” typing experience.

 On the other end of the spectrum is something like the [Keychron K3](https://www.keychron.com/collections/keychron-k-series-keyboard/products/keychron-k3-wireless-mechanical-keyboard), a cheaper alternative that suffers both in terms of acoustics and build quality but that won’t hurt your pocket as much if you’re testing the waters.

 The “real” competitor in this review, for me, was the Magic Keyboard. Even after my time spent with the Air75 V2, I still think Apple’s keyboard is a great choice. You might even be able to type faster on it and make fewer mistakes. It’s light and bouncy, and it even features Touch ID if you spring for the pricier version. Some people will prefer the Magic Keyboard to any mechanical keyboard, and that’s ok.

 But it’s also a world away from being a mechanical keyboard. It’s not as satisfying to type on, even if it feels like a less taxing experience for your fingers. If you’re bored with Apple peripherals, the Nuphy Air75 V2 is a great gateway into the world of mechanical keyboards.
