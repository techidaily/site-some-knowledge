![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/../image-style/new-seo/icon6.png) By [Candice Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/candice-liu-444483a3/) to HEVC｜Last updated on Jan 12, 2020 

HEVC (H265) is widely used by Apple on its ecosystem including iOS 11, macOS High Sierra, watchOS and tvOS. As for playing HEVC video on iPhone, the minimum threshold is to update your iPhone to iOS 11 or later first. Theoretically, all the iPhone models from iPhone 5S to the latest iPhone 11 support HEVC video playback. Yet there will be problematic when viewing some 4K HEVC files. This is because HEVC demands highly on hardware. Below are the specific iPhone's hardware configuration for HEVC playback. 

• iPhone with Apple's A9 chip or newer, incl. iPhone 11/Pro/Max, XS/XR/X/8/7/6s/SE, support playing HEVC video at up to **4K 2160p**.  
 • iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus just play HEVC video with max resolution of **1080p at 240 fps**.  
 • iPhone 5S just enables smooth playback of HEVC **1080p at 60 fps** or **720p at 240 fps**.

Hence, if you find your HEVC video won't play normally on your iPhone, the video resolution and frame rate are to be blamed. To fix the HEVC not playing issue, [**MacX Video Converter Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) comes to rescue your HEVC video: convert HEVC to MP4/MOV H.264, lower 4K to 1080p, change frame rate to 60fps/30fps to best suit your iPhone requirements. You can even convert any video to iPhone preset profile without even know the obscure parameter settings.

##  Part 2 - Can't Play HEVC Movie Downloads/Records on iPhone? Fix Here!

Many a user is apt to [download HEVC movies](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and play them on iPhone offline. Yet, the majority of HEVC movies originate from DVDRip, HD camcorder, web HDRip or BrRip. They come with different movie resolutions, bit rates, frame rates, etc., which, to great extent, make it tricky to play HEVC movies on iPhone. Additionally, some video shootings taken by iPhone or other camcorders might also pose playback issue due to improper operations.

The effective solution you can try is to switch to another [HEVC player](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). CnX Player and H265 are the top two choices for your reference.
