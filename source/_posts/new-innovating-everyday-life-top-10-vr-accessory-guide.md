As VR pursues to develop more immersive with every new upgrade of hardware, [VR peripheral](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) creators are trying a thoughtful effort to cover the fact that you are using a controller. There are numerous gloves that need you to 'feel' virtual reality with your hands but Manus [VR glove](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) needs to plunge your whole arm.

## [7. Unlimited Hand](http://unlimitedhand.com/)

This self-effacing little gadget might be the utmost exclusive and somewhat frightening VR peripheral soon coming into the market. The UnlimitedHand, a prime band automated with haptic response technology that lines with the Oculus as well as HTC Vive through Bluetooth, can both sense and effect your actions while you are playing a VR game. When you move your fingers, in reality, the UnlimitedHand will adapt that info, and make your digital, the in-game form does the same action; if you form a gun figure with your hand, the UnlimitedHand will sense that too, allowing you use this finger-gun in an accustomed FPS game.

## [8. VR Backpacks](http://store.hp.com/us/en/cv/omenxvrpcpack)

Although untethered VR peripherals of PC are not yet popular enough and released but some of these crazy contraptions are not long ways off.

## [9. Reactive Grip Motion Controller](http://tacticalhaptics.com/)

And the reactive grip motion controller from the tactical haptics fits perfectly into the same class of the peripherals dealing with tactics. It is a way of more precise evolution in this field, and it works with all the three best VR boxes of the time.

## [10. 3DRudder](https://www.3drudder.com/)

If we talk about moving feet in a VR game, most of the peripherals only use traditional gaming mode. So, in order to widen this concept, the designers at 3DRudder designed a virtual reality footpad that permits the user to all of the movements, vertical, horizontal and turning while using only his feet. Though there are no words on jumping yet.

## [7. Unlimited Hand](http://unlimitedhand.com/)

This self-effacing little gadget might be the utmost exclusive and somewhat frightening VR peripheral soon coming into the market. The UnlimitedHand, a prime band automated with haptic response technology that lines with the Oculus as well as HTC Vive through Bluetooth, can both sense and effect your actions while you are playing a VR game. When you move your fingers, in reality, the UnlimitedHand will adapt that info, and make your digital, the in-game form does the same action; if you form a gun figure with your hand, the UnlimitedHand will sense that too, allowing you use this finger-gun in an accustomed FPS game.

## [10. 3DRudder](https://www.3drudder.com/)

If we talk about moving feet in a VR game, most of the peripherals only use traditional gaming mode. So, in order to widen this concept, the designers at 3DRudder designed a virtual reality footpad that permits the user to all of the movements, vertical, horizontal and turning while using only his feet. Though there are no words on jumping yet.
