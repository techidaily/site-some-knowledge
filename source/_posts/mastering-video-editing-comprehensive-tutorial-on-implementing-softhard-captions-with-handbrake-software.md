## Way 2: How to Use Handbrake to Attach Soft Subtitle to Movie Videos

As the latest Handbrake V1.0.7, the 64-bit build, features soft subtitle adding power, you can display subtitles is by making part of the movie video with option to turn on or off the subtitle. 

**Step 1: Search the Subtitles You Prefer**  
 Just google to find and [download movie subtitles](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) from the web. Please note that subtitle files can be easily found on the internet but there is no 100% guarantee for the existence.   
Generally, the subtitle files are saved in.srt and.sub. But Handbrake only accepts SRT as the subtitle input. For an effective subtitle file searching, you can put "movie title "+" your preferred language "+"subtitle" as the search strings and select the subtitle file saved in .srt.
