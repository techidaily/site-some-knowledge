## Frequently Asked Questions about ISO to MKV Conversion

**Q: Why won't turn ISO image to MKV using MakeMKV?**

A: MakeMKV is known for making digital backups of DVDs for enjoying freely and quickly. It is still in beta version, which means you can free switch ISO/DVD to MKV without paying anything. But MakeMKV doesn't work well on the latest Mac and Windows version and won't support newly released DVDs, or iSO images. For example, users in MakeMKV forum indicate that the free iSO to MKV converter won't choose the correct playlist, has no subtitles or gets black frames throughout the whole movie after the conversion, corrupt or invalid source file, OS/Scsi error, etc. So you have to turn to [MakeMKV alternative](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)to do it.

**Q: Why DVD ripper crashes and doesn't show the correct length of the movie?**

A: Technically, this is a result of copy protections encoded on DVDs. Newly movies such as Manchester by the Sea, Hacksaw Ridge, Finding Dory, etc are typically placed with 98 fake titles and one correct. Common ISO converter cannot choose the right one and even show no valid source found error. So you have to turn to a powerful ISO Image to MKV ripper to bypass the protection schemes and rip protected DVD smoothly.
