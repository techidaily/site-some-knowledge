Samsung galaxy tablet is a hot android-based tablet and its Hub Books app makes you enjoy thousands of books. But it's a pity for us that in July 1st 2014 Samsung Books hub will officially close. It's not like that Sony closed Reader store in the North American market. So far, there is no any migration plan to protect books content from loss. In other words, if you ever have bought books from Hub Books, all your paid digital content will lose forever. So I will introduce how to read books on Samsung galaxy tab without Hub Books app and back up your own digital books from Samsung Reader Hub.

### Kindle for Samsung to replace Hub Books

Samsung decides to cooperate with Amazon and launch this Samsung for Kindle. It can solve the drawbacks of Samsung Books store can't offer all books service in all markets and the whole Samsung tablets. Where can I download this app to my Samsung tablet? [Kindle for Samsung](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapps.samsung.com%2Fmars%2Fappquery%2FappDetail.as%3FCOUNTRY%255FCODE%3DUSA%26appId%3Dcom.amazon.kindlefs) now is only available from the Samsung official website. 

Or download the Samsung app store to install Kindle for Samsung. For Samsung users, there is no need to worry about your galaxy note 10.1 doesn't recognize the kindle app as before. Because Kindle for Samsung was available on all devices on April 14 2014.

Once you install it, you can login the Amazon account and you can read kindle books which you buy from Amazon bookstore. This tailored application offers free bestselling books when you login with the Samsung account. [Register Samsung account here](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Faccount)**.**

In early 2011, Samsung started to cooperate with Kobo bookstore and sold books on the tablets and smartphone. Later they bypassed Kobo bookstore and began with negotiating with publishers. And the Hub books application developed by Samsung is compatible with **EPUB, HTML5, PDF**. So how to back up hub books or convert these ebooks to compatible with the new default reader application? Otherwise, as the Samsung official website said, all paid ebooks from Hub library will disappear in July 1, 2014\. 

It seems like a disaster but don't worry. Epubor Ultimate Converter is your best option to convert any ebooks to the default supported format (**Kindle format, mobi, pdf**, etc).

I loved the Readers Hub app on my 10.1 tab. It was such a good ebook app if you just want to load all your books and simply read them. Today I was forced to download the Kindle for Samsung app, due to the Readers Hub app being discontinued, took 30-40mins. I had about 60 books loaded on Readers Hub. The new replacement app would not sync my books to the app. I am so angry. Why would Samsung do this considering there is a Kindle app available in their Play Store. Im very unhappy, I sincerely hope Samsung get tons and tons of complaints. Readers Hub as a great ebook app and to replace it with this garbage is unacceptable. NOT HAPPY!!!!!!!!

I agree completely. One more thong is that we could write notes with the s-pen with Readers Hub - now we can not!!!  
 I tried to go back to the factory version and my effort ended with the complete uninstall of Readers Hub. I want this feature back from Samsung - the s-pen annotations was the reason that I bought Samsung Note - now it seems that this reason does not exist anymore!!
