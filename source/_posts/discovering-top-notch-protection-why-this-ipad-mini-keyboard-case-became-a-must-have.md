 My iPad mini is one of my favorite gadgets. It gives me more workable space than an iPhone, but is still small and light enough to take anywhere. But there's one thing it lacks for getting real work done: a keyboard.

##  The iPad mini Needs a Keyboard, Too

 There's one place where the iPad mini comes up short against it's larger contemporaries: the distinct lack of keyboard support. I don't mean [normal Bluetooth keyboards](https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-depth-effect-issues-on-ios-16-7-essential-solutions/) or wired peripherals, as those work perfectly as they would with any device. I mean those snazzy keyboard cases widely available for [larger iPad models](https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-power-of-asus-rt-ac88u-a-detailed-look-at-its-gaming-capabilities/), several of which are made and sold by Apple itself.

 I understand why this is: a keyboard small enough to fit on an iPad mini wouldn't be practical for most people to use. But for those of us with smaller hands, the size isn't a huge issue. After trying out several different iPad mini keyboard cases, one clearly rose to the top, despite them all having their own strengths.

CRIBUN Store

 The first case I tried was [CRIBUN's Wireless Detachable Keyboard folio case](http://www.amazon.com/Keyboard-Case-iPad-Mini-2021/dp/B09GFX8L29/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003639&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fafter-trying-countless-ipad-mini-keyboard-cover-cases-heres-my-favorite%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), with its magnetically attached keyboard. It follows the same design choices as many iPad mini Keyboards, with folio-style support and a keyboard that must be slid forward to give the iPad room to stand.

 It attaches to the iPad mini with a full rubber case that feels fairly protective and even has a dedicated Apple Pencil slot on top. The folio itself uses nice, strong magnets to keep the case closed when not in use.

 However, there is a reason I continued looking after trying this case. My main issue was battery life, as I found my keyboard would die after about an hour or so of continuous use. For how bulky it made my iPad feel, I expected better performance. Having the option to remove the keyboard was a nice touch, but the magnets on the case itself were too weak to keep it in place while typing.

 Overall, I would recommend this case for someone who prioritizes protection, but it will add significant weight and thickness alongside a subpar typing experience.

Typecase

 I figured if I was going to buy a case that would add significant weight to my iPad mini, I would at least get a case with a trackpad. This led me to try out the [Typecase iPad mini keyboard](http://typecase.co/products/typecase-keyboard-case-for-ipad-mini-6-trackpad-wireless-case-with-keyboard-for-ipad-mini-6th-generation-8-3-2021-10-colors-backlit-keyboard-cover-dark-gray), which, as a big fan of [funky RGB lighting](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-brand-collaboration-on-youtube/), caught my eye as soon as I saw it.

 It foregoes the folio-style keyboard case for a sturdy, self-supporting laptop style. The hinge also rotates 360 degrees, allowing the keyboard to fold flat against the back of the iPad when not in use.

 My main problem with this case is that, in my opinion, it's too ambitious. A keyboard case for an iPad mini is already pushing it size-wise, so adding a trackpad on top of it made it feel way too cramped. The keyboard itself was impossible to get comfortable with, and the trackpad was small to the point of being more cumbersome than helpful.

 I think the biggest consequence of these features, however, is the toll they take on battery life. It doesn't come as a shock that keyboard lighting would drain the battery, but in combination with the keyboard and trackpad, it becomes impractical. The subsequent thickness would have been fine, as I had planned to take it on and off as needed, but the case is seriously difficult to remove.

 I can see this keyboard case being perfect for users looking to turn their iPad mini into a laptop-like device, but I couldn't contend with the weight and poor battery life.

 When I ordered [GreenLaw's iPad mini 6 case](http://www.amazon.com/GreenLaw-Keyboard-Detachable-Bluetooth-Rechargeable/dp/B09PV79TJ1/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003639&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fafter-trying-countless-ipad-mini-keyboard-cover-cases-heres-my-favorite%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), I thought I had finally found the one. It solved many of my complaints about thickness, as the keyboard could be removed when not in use to turn it into a standard, rubber iPad case. I also liked that the hinge was sturdy enough to hold the iPad up without extra folio support. USB-C charging support is always appreciated, so I was excited to try it out when it arrived.

 When I first put it on my iPad mini, I was extremely happy with it. It looked sleek, the keyboard could be easily attached and removed, and the keyboard itself had rubber feet that prevented it from moving too much during typing. It was pretty heavy, but because the keyboard could be removed, I didn't feel this would be an issue.

 The problems started when I actually tried to use it. No matter what I tried, I could not get the keyboard to pair with any of my devices. Eventually, there was a glimmer of hope when I was able to select the keyboard from the Bluetooth menu before it disappeared, but it only registered roughly every fifth input. I can't say whether or not all of these keyboards have these connectivity issues, but mine was completely unusable.

HOU Keyboards

 Dejected by my past failures, I was determined that this keyboard case would be the last one I tried. I was starting to think maybe iPad mini keyboards just weren't for me, but I figured I'd give it one final shot with [HOU's Ultra-Slim iPad Mini Keyboard case](http://www.amazon.com/HOU-8-3-inch-Keyboard-Protective-Generation/dp/B0BFL8PY24/ref=cm%5Fcr%5Farp%5Fd%5Fproduct%5Ftop?ie=UTF8&th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003639&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fafter-trying-countless-ipad-mini-keyboard-cover-cases-heres-my-favorite%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen).

 For my taste, this keyboard was exactly what I was looking for. It was by far the thinnest I'd tried, and because I wasn't very concerned with protection, a keyboard case that didn't completely destroy the iPad mini's portability was a huge perk.

 HOU also solved the folio problem pretty creatively. The entire thing attaches magnetically to the back of the iPad, so to stand it up, you can just fold the back of the case to create a stand. It leaves part of the iPad exposed, but if it's in a standing position, it shouldn't be too likely to face damage.

 I am shocked that a keyboard case this thin can even exist. Charging takes place over a magnetic charger, not too dissimilar from the Apple Watch, which helps to save significant thickness. Unlike the other keyboard cases I've tried, I never feel the need to remove this one when I'm reading or not using the keyboard, because it's thin enough to not be a bother.

 Another huge win for this case is the keyboard itself. It has by far the best feeling keys of any case I've tried, and the short key travel was easy to get used to. Overall, HOU's iPad mini Keyboard checked all of my boxes and still works perfectly after two years of use.

 After an iPad keyboard journey full of trials and tribulations, I'm grateful that I found one that looks, feels, and works great. This definitely isn't the case for everyone, especially considering it's thinness and lack of a trackpad, but for an iPad mini user who appreciates portability, it is definitely a great choice.
