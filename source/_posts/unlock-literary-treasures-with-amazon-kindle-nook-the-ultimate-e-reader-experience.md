[Tried unsuccessfully to remove DRM from NOOK books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/6/2019 1:05:53 PM 

I've tried a number of ways to get DRM removed from NOOK books. all unsuccessful. (epubor ultimate, calibre/deDRM)  
 no luck. Has anyone been successful in making this work in 2019? it seems changes were made at end of 2018 to make this more difficult.

 If your software can do this, I will be purchasing it. I was attempting this with Trial copy. if I need a license to make this work, please let me know...jpal

[Nook - getting it to read books through epubor off Kobo](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/2/2019 10:41:43 PM 

Everything has been working perfectly on epubor for years. I can manage to get my nook books and those from kobo. I put them onto an SD card and then into my old e-reader. Three weeks ago, something changed. When I convert the books and then transfer to SD for my e-reader, the reader shows the files in the directory but cannot detect them as ebooks. They are in the same nodrm format as always. Older books in the same author folder work fine. It works OK still for nook books, but no longer for those from kobo. Ideas?

[How do I download epub versions from the nook windows app?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/20/2019 9:18:46 AM 

I am trying to figure out if I can convert my nook books so that I can access them on my Kindle Paperwhite. I have been searching everywhere but I cannot figure it out. I downloaded the nook app for windows and downloaded a few of the books. I was able to find the folder where they are stored but they are not .epub files so I'm at a loss at what I am supposed to do now. I tried installing Nook for PC but was unable to login. 

[Opening in another program after conversion](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/27/2020 8:25:20 AM 

I batch deDrm'd nook books and only some of them were successful. Others said they weren't downloaded completely, but I don't know what that means. I downloaded them on the nook app, so how much further can I download them?

 Also, the ones that WERE successful, I can't seem to open them in different programs now, specifically Calibre. Is this software attempting to make you use their eReader to view the books after conversion?

[When will Ultimate be able to remove DRM from Nook books?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 5/6/2019 4:05:12 PM 

I have been using Epubor Ultimate for several years and have previously been able to remove DRM from purchased Nook books. I notice that the latest version of Ultimate (3.0.11) no longer has Nook included in the menu for removing Nook DRM which I think coincides with BN no longer supporting "Nook for PC" software. I understand you are working to regain that functionality. Do you have a timeframe as to when that may be accomplished?
