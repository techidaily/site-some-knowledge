## Exclusive Duo Privacy Plan: Proton's New Secure Email Service

Proton just introduced Proton Duo, a new subscription plan that lets you share a Proton account with another person. Proton Duo is cheaper than two Proton Unlimited subscriptions, so you’ll be saving at least $60 a year.

 Both users get their own accounts, managed separately. “Proton Duo gives you separate login information, so you can keep your emails, calendars, and files to yourself. You get to decide what to share with your partner or family member,” Proton clarified in the press release.

 Proton Duo has all the features and access you get with [Proton Unlimited](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-a-network-locked-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-phone-by-drfone-android/), including custom email domains. A Proton Unlimited subscription entitles you to 500GB of cloud storage. With Proton Duo, you get 1TB of storage, and 15GB of bonus storage every year on top of that. Proton lets you allocate storage to your partner. Users can choose what to share in storage. The same goes for [Proton Pass](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-maximizing-your-designs-with-free-clip-art/) with the shared logins and [Proton Calendar](https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-benefits-of-using-video-for-social-media-marketing/).

 You can buy the annual Proton Duo plan for $14.99 a month. The one-year Proton Unlimited subscription costs $10.99\. That comes out to an almost $60 discount on the annual plan. The offer is valid for a limited time only, but users who purchase the plan before it expires will get the discount forever.

 To subscribe to the Proton Duo plan, you can either create a new account with it or upgrade your subscription. If you’re upgrading the account, your pending months will be credited. To get your partner on the same plan, have them set up a Proton account (if they don’t have one already) and send them an invitation. If you ever remove the partner from your Duo plan, Proton will put them on the Unlimited plan for a month to keep their data safe.

 Proton’s marketing leans heavily into making it a safe and private alternative to “Big Tech” apps. And according to Proton, if your partner is using those apps, it naturally exposes your info too.
