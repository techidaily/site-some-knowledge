Jaunt primarily collaborated with Paul McCartney in 2014, who is part of The Beatles. Together, they built a 360-degree complete immersive concert experience, giving users a VR head mounted device.

 Later, Jaunt worked with The Northface and introduced a project popularly known as “The Northface VR”.
