I have downloaded Epubor and trying to remove the DRM from a Nook book that I had recently purchased. I went through the steps on https://www.epubor.com/faq.html#e303 and downloaded/installed Nook Study but was unable to login. I am not sure what I am not doing correctly unless it is that I have to purchase the licensed version of Epubor.

Hi I'm using your trial version of Ultimate. A Nook option is not in the vendor list on the left panel. (Yes, I clicked the ellipses button, not there either).  
 I'm on a Windows 10 Desktop computer.   
 As you probably know, Nook for PC no longer works. So I've deleted the program, however the downloads directory (containing books) is still on the computer. Folder: D:\\Documents\\My Barnes & Noble   
 Most if not all of these book are key encrypted with the old B&N method of user name + credit card #.

Hello, the NOOK device has been connected to my MAC OS (Mojave). When I navigate to Finder and select the NOOK and then select the books folder - it is empty as in not showing anything. I am unable to transfer the files (books) into the Epubor app.
