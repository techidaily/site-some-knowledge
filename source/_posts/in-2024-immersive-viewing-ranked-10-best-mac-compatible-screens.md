## Part 1: Things to Consider When Buying a Monitor for Mac

#### Section 1.Ports

There are two common options for connectivity, either you can access thunderbolt or go for HDMI cables. The ThunderBolt connectivity option gives you two connection abilities, either you can try the first generation system or go for advanced 2nd and 3rd generation. Each one of these have different capabilities. The Thunderbolt 1 offers easy connection with DisplayPort 1.1 a and allows maximum video throughput of 8.64 GBPS. ThunderBolt 2 can handle Display Port 1.2 with maximum video throughput ranging up to 17.28 GBPS. Third option is ThunderBolt 3 that has ability to work with 40GBPS throughput.

HDMI ports also assist in easy connectivity with MacBook Pro, Mac mini and Mac Pro models. Most of the latest Mac units are designed with HDMI 1.4 connectivity option that can handle 4K Display and Ultra HD Display at 24Hz and 30Hz rating respectively. On the other side, HDMI 2.0 offers 4K display connectivity while handling 60 Hz output.

#### Section 2.4K Supported Macs

#### Section 3.Single Stream (SST) Displays and Multi Stream Transport (MST) Displays

The 4K resolution with 60Hz range is often managed with Multi-Stream Transport technology because this method helps to combine two halves impressively on single larger surface.
