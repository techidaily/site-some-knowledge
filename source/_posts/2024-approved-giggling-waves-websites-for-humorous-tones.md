Filmora is a user-friendly video editor and very affordable. It has various features, including Audio Detach, [Silence Detection](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [Audio Ducking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and so on.

Then, launch the software and click **“Import”** to add two funny video songs to create a Keen funny ringtone.

Step2 Next, drag the files to the **“Timeline Panel.”** Now, right-click the video files and select **“Detach Audio”** to extract funny audio from videos, which will show on the audio track.

Step3 Now right-click only that song whose silent parts you want to delete and select **“Silence Detection.”** A window will open with three parameters; **“Threshold,” “Minimum Silence,” and “Buffer,”** which you can adjust manually or by clicking **“Start”** to perform silence detection automatically.
