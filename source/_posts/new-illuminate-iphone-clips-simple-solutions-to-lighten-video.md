Have you ever watched a video on your iPhone and thought it didn't look so great? The colors were off, the blurry image and the white balance were blown out. If you have an iPhone or iPad, you know what I'm talking about. You've got a video that you shot on your iPhone. It looks great, but what if you want to make it a little more "professional"? There are times when you have dark lighting, or the sun is in your face, regardless of what's causing the lighting to be dim.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, then videos are worth more than spoken language. Today the trend is high-quality videos on social media platforms, and your video should be perfect. But sometimes, we face trouble with our video. Not every video you take has the correct exposure or brightness. The video can have the wrong color balance, but a few tricks enhance iPhone video brightness within a few minutes.

## How will brightness affect your video?

Brightness is one of the most significant factors in determining image quality. Anytime someone talks about color, they mention brightness. A system's brightness can display light and dark details in an image. The ability to display brightness significantly impacts video quality because the video camera captures much brighter or darker images than standard video signals can handle. Brightness may be used as an important controlling factor for video effects (e.g., producing a realistic effect, making a shot more dramatic). However, if brightness is not well controlled, the desired effect of the scene may also change dramatically, and these changes will be visible to viewers.

Brightness, or the lack of it, will significantly impact how your video looks to your viewers. As you know, brightness and contrast affect how much information is revealed in an image. It depends on the brightness level to display the video with precise white balance, thus optimizing the video image quality. The brightness/contrast settings should always be adjusted carefully during editing and mastering your videos to display colors and shades accurately.

Have you ever watched a video on your iPhone and thought it didn't look so great? The colors were off, the blurry image and the white balance were blown out. If you have an iPhone or iPad, you know what I'm talking about. You've got a video that you shot on your iPhone. It looks great, but what if you want to make it a little more "professional"? There are times when you have dark lighting, or the sun is in your face, regardless of what's causing the lighting to be dim.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, then videos are worth more than spoken language. Today the trend is high-quality videos on social media platforms, and your video should be perfect. But sometimes, we face trouble with our video. Not every video you take has the correct exposure or brightness.

## How will brightness affect your video?

Brightness is one of the most significant factors in determining image quality. Anytime someone talks about color, they mention brightness. A system's brightness can display light and dark details in an image. The ability to display brightness significantly impacts video quality because the video camera captures much brighter or darker images than standard video signals can handle. Brightness may be used as an important controlling factor for video effects (e.g., producing a realistic effect, making a shot more dramatic). However, if brightness is not well controlled, the desired effect of the scene may also change dramatically, and these changes will be visible to viewers.

Brightness, or the lack of it, will significantly impact how your video looks to your viewers. As you know, brightness and contrast affect how much information is revealed in an image. It depends on the brightness level to display the video with precise white balance, thus optimizing the video image quality. The brightness/contrast settings should always be adjusted carefully during editing and mastering your videos to display colors and shades accurately.

Have you ever watched a video on your iPhone and thought it didn't look so great? The colors were off, the blurry image and the white balance were blown out. If you have an iPhone or iPad, you know what I'm talking about. You've got a video that you shot on your iPhone. It looks great, but what if you want to make it a little more "professional"? There are times when you have dark lighting, or the sun is in your face, regardless of what's causing the lighting to be dim.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, then videos are worth more than spoken language. Today the trend is high-quality videos on social media platforms, and your video should be perfect. But sometimes, we face trouble with our video. Not every video you take has the correct exposure or brightness.

## How will brightness affect your video?

Brightness is one of the most significant factors in determining image quality. Anytime someone talks about color, they mention brightness. A system's brightness can display light and dark details in an image. The ability to display brightness significantly impacts video quality because the video camera captures much brighter or darker images than standard video signals can handle. Brightness may be used as an important controlling factor for video effects (e.g., producing a realistic effect, making a shot more dramatic). However, if brightness is not well controlled, the desired effect of the scene may also change dramatically, and these changes will be visible to viewers.

Brightness, or the lack of it, will significantly impact how your video looks to your viewers. As you know, brightness and contrast affect how much information is revealed in an image. It depends on the brightness level to display the video with precise white balance, thus optimizing the video image quality. The brightness/contrast settings should always be adjusted carefully during editing and mastering your videos to display colors and shades accurately.

### Method1: Brighten a video on iPhone using iMovie

A popular video editing app for iPhones (and iPads, iPod Touches, and Macs) is iMovie, developed by Apple Inc. With iMovie's latest version, not only can you edit videos, but you can also modify and enhance video color settings. For example, you can make automatic color adjustments, match the look of one clip to another, fix a discolored clip, adjust the clip's color by adjusting its skin tone, and make manual color adjustments. The iMovie App on iPhone allows you to quickly change your video's lighting. Just follow the steps mentioned below.
