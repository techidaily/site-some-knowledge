4\. On the**Permissions**tab you should see permissions that are there. 3 permissions below you will see: ‘**SYSTEM** ‘ with Full control which applies to ‘This folder, subfolders and files’‘**Administrators**‘ with Full control which applies to ‘This folder, subfolders and files’ ‘**Your** **Username**‘ with Full control which applies to ‘This folder, subfolders and files’ These all 3 permissions should be inherited from the**C:\\Users\\\[Username\]\\**folder. If you don’t have the ‘Include inheritable permissions from this object’s parent’ option ticked, click on**Change Permissions…**.

After you follow steps above, you should have the permissions to write to the directory and you won’t get those error messages any more.   
  
**Solution 3:** It may be HIPS (Host-based Intrusion Prevention System HIPS) causing this false positive. Try fully disabling your anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall applications.
