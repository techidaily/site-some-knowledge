## Who is working with Jaunt?

 Later, Jaunt worked with The Northface and introduced a project popularly known as “The Northface VR”.

Earlier in 2015, you have witnessed how aggressive Jaunt VR was to offer the best possible virtual reality experience.

 The story doesn’t end here because Jaunt also teamed up with director Paul Feig to make a VR experience project. They called it “Other Space”. It was released in April 2015, displaying at SXSW.
