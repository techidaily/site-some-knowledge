## Gentle Volume Easing Methods for Mixers

As a result of its distinctive method of loop-based composition, Ableton live fades are favorite among hip-hop and electronic music producers. Ableton Live is one of the greatest DAWs to learn if you're just beginning to make beats or write songs. For many artists, Ableton Live has emerged as the preferred setting for writing music with an eye on live performance. If you're coming from a conventionally built digital audio workstation, Live's approach to composition and arrangement is undoubtedly odd.

One of the most user-friendly pieces of music software ever created is Ableton Live. With a little instruction, you can quickly master Ableton fade and produce recordings of studio-caliber. Since then, Ableton has emerged as one of the top names in electronic music production. Live is a robust DAW with mature capabilities that can be used to produce any kind of music, although it works especially well with certain processes. Follow this guide to learn about Ableton fade in detail.

## Part 1\. 2 Ways to Fade audio in Ableton

You've certainly heard the terms "audio fade-in" and "audio fade-out" a few times as a newbie, and you may be wondering what they mean and how you might apply them to your films. Crossfading clips on the same track is easier and only needs one track, however crossfading clips on different tracks allows you to apply independent audio effects processing and gives greater flexibility in structuring the fade curves. Both strategies may be helpful for organizing and creating sounds.

### Way 1\. Use Warp/Fades

To avoid any clicks, turn on Create Fades on Clip Edges in the Record/Warp/Launch section of Live's Preferences. The beginning and ending of the Clip will each have a little fade.

![create fades warp fades](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-fades-warp-fades.jpg)

You must disable the automated mode in order to alter the clip fades. You may accomplish this by doing the following:

![disable automated mode ableton](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/disable-automated-mode-ableton.jpg)

The fade-in and fade-out handles should display when you hover the mouse icon over the audio clip you want to fade. In case, if they don't, hit 'A' on your keyboard to make them appear. Then, you hold down the mouse button while left-clicking on the handle you wish to fade and lowering the fader.

### Way 2\. Using the MIDI Track

In the method 2, you can use it on MIDI track. It will load the Utility effect to the specified MIDI track wherever you drag it on the track. Left-click on the little box in the bottom right corner of the DAW to view the Utility effect on your track. Follow the procedure below to do so.
Live's ability to easily clean up the beginning and conclusion of audio samples has long been one of its strengths. Simply hit A and hover over the clip to check sure Automation Mode isn't turned on. There are two handles you may drag on the left and right, as well as two curve adjusters:
