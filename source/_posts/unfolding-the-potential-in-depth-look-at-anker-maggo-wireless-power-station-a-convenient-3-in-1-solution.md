## Unfolding the Potential: In-Depth Look at Anker MagGo Wireless Power Station, A Convenient 3-in-1 Solution

### Key Takeaways

* The Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station is lightweight, portable, and easy to use, making it a must-have for cramped spaces.
* The charger features an ARM Cortex-M processor and AI-driven algorithms for efficient charging and heat dissipation.
* The MagGo provides fast charging for iPhone and AirPods, with a max output of 15W, and comes with a USB-C cable and wall adapter.

 The [Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charging-Certified-MagSafe-Compatible-Wireless/dp/B0CF56WHV4?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001637&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fanker-maggo-wireless-charging-station-foldable-3-in-1-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) (Foldable 3-in-1) is everything I wanted it to be: lightweight, intuitive to use, and easy to stow away. While a USB input or two would have gone the extra mile for me, I do think this is one of the more exceptional wireless charging stations I’ve tested.

##  Design: A Must-Have for Cramped Confines

![The provided charger with the Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Stand (Foldable 3-in-1)](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/provided-charger-with-the-anker-maggo-wireless-charging-station-foldable-3-in-1jpg_53466935917_o.jpg)

 Available in black and white finishes, the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 is about half the size of the average smartphone. Measuring 3.5 inches from top to bottom, 2.36 inches from left to right, 0.98 inches from front to back, and weighing just 0.43 pounds, Apple devotees will always want to keep this thing on standby. It’s easy to pick up and re-position and is small enough to tuck into any type of bag or carrying case.

 The MagGo 3-in-1 could be a replacement for Apple's MagSafe Duo, a portable charging station with two wireless charging spots. The MagGo 3-in-1 keeps portability in mind while adding an extra wireless charging area. Actually, both the MagGo 3-in-1 and MagSafe Duo are quite similar to a travel-friendly charger from Twelve South called the [ButterFly 2-in-1](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-windows-playback-system/).

 The Qi2 wireless phone module is front and center. Even though the magnetic pad is designed with MagSafe-compatible iPhones in mind, I don’t think there would be an issue with docking a magnetic Android device. The silicone-padded Qi2 module is hinged, revealing a Qi pad (for charging AirPods and other low-wattage MagSafe devices) when the Qi2 module is raised up.

 I was happy to see plentiful heat-venting on the wireless portion of the charger, and there’s even more venting on the bottom part of the station. This is also where Anker decided to place the foldaway 5W Apple Watch charger.

 It’s hard enough to find _any_ company that will supply its own USB-C accessories these days, so I appreciated the fact that the device comes with its own USB-C cable and 40W wall adapter. That being said, it would have been cool if Anker thought to include a USB input or two on the charging station itself. The only physical port to speak of is strictly for power, as the MagGo 3-in-1 doesn’t include a built-in battery.

##  Features: Algorithmic AI for All Your Charging Needs

 When it comes to wireless chargers, you want to place your bets on a company that’s going to prioritize fast, powerful, and reliable re-juicing of your tech. I give Anker big props for the engineering team’s focus on heat dissipation, which is always one of my concerns when reviewing any type of [charger](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-microsoft-hololens-demo-tomorrows-tech-today/).

 At the core of the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 is an ARM Cortex-M 32-bit processor, which is responsible for handling the charger’s AI-driven algorithms. When using all three charge points on the station, I thought it did an exceptional job at charging the components that needed the _most_ charge first (which was usually my iPhone), and I’m betting this is exactly what the algorithmic chipset is designed for.

 Anker also claims that the entire charging station is safeguarded by the company’s own MultiProtect Safety System, which covers foreign object detection, radiation shielding, over-current protection, and over-voltage protection.

 I tested the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 using an iPhone 12 and the AirPods Pro 2\. Even though I don’t own an Apple Watch, the foldout node delivers the same amount of wireless power (5W) as the AirPods dock, so I was at least able to test the second 5W charging post.

 I love this thing. Personally, I’d run out and buy one right now, based on its iPhone charging capabilities alone. Most of the wireless charging stations I’ve tested tend to overheat both the charger and the device it’s connected to. This was _never_ the case here, and it was really nice to not have to worry about heat dissipation for once when testing a charger.

 As far as output goes, the max the MagGo 3-in-1 is capable of is 15W from the Qi2 pad. Anker claims this should be enough power to recharge an iPhone 15 from zero to 20% battery in as little as 15 minutes. I was able to charge my iPhone 12 from 42% battery to 63% in around 40 minutes. I had a similar charging experience when charging both my phone and the AirPods at the same time.
