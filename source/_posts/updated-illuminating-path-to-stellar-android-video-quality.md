Video brightness is measured in terms of the maximum brightness. The higher the brightness, the more luminous the picture will be. This means that bright and dark scenes will both be more easily identifiable.

In technical terms, the brightness of a video image is measured in nits. One nit is equal to one candela per square meter. If you have a television or monitor that is rated at 100 nits, it means it has a luminance of 100 Candelas per square meter (cd/m2).

#### What should my video brightness be?

The brightness of your videos should always be medium. Too much or too little brightness can make the video look unnatural, and viewers may be able to see details in the video. Also, too much brightness will cause color saturation problems.

#### Is it easy to brighten a video?

The brightness of a video refers to the level of white in the video. It is different from lightness, which refers to the average level of all colors in a frame. The brightness is measured by calculating the average value of all color channels in the frame. This can be used to adjust the contrast and brightness by increasing or decreasing this value.

#### Will I lose any quality when brightening a video?

There is a relatively simple answer to this question. When you are brightening a video that is too dark, there is no degradation in the quality of the image as long as you aren't drastically changing brightness levels. If you make minimal adjustments, there shouldn't be any noticeable difference in the overall quality of the original image.
