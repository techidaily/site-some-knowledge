## Question 5: Filmora purchase

![will next versions of filmora be valid on the lifetime license](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-27.png)

If you bought Filmora 9 lifetime license years ago, you can upgrade to Filmora X and use the same license. However, since Filmora X, there is no lifetime license anymore. Instead, a perpetual license is made for a specific version of Filmora. It includes minor updates continually with payment of a single fee, but for major upgrades, like Filmora 11 to Filmora 12, there will be an additional fee. Therefore, the answer is no.

It is a great question. You might have noticed a crown icon next to some features in Filmora. It is for specific editing features accessible to users only with a Filmora license.

These features include 4K video export, keyframing, speed ramping, and many more. Purchase a Filmora license from their official website and enjoy these beautiful features.

If you bought Filmora 9 lifetime license years ago, you can upgrade to Filmora X and use the same license. However, since Filmora X, there is no lifetime license anymore. Instead, a perpetual license is made for a specific version of Filmora. It includes minor updates continually with payment of a single fee, but for major upgrades, like Filmora 11 to Filmora 12, there will be an additional fee. Therefore, the answer is no.
