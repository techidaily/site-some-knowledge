## 8\. Ukrainian Athlete Shows ‘No War' Sign During Skeleton Event

We are all aware of the tensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their peak and there are many experts who believe the countries are on the verge of declaring war. Even though The Winter Olympics should have ideally been an apolitical event, Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych flashed a sign that read “No War in Ukraine” to spark a political controversy.

He showed the sign directly to the cameras after he finished his run at Beijing Olympics. It remains to be seen if any penalty will be imposed on him but Heraskevych has said that he is ready to face any repercussion even though he hopes that the Olympics will support him instead.

## 9\. American Favorite Out of the Tournament

US skater Vincent Zhou has tested positive for coronavirus and therefore, he is out of the Winter Olympics. Naturally, Zhou was in tears and extremely emotional as he was a top medal contender. He did take part in the team free skate event but he struggle to perform at his best even though the US team managed to win silver at the event.

Zhou is considering the silver win as a consolation prize but he could not showcase his brilliance at the singles competitions. However, he said that he would prepare for the Winter Olympics in Milan and make a bigger comeback the world has not seen yet.

## 10\. Russian Figure Skater Tests Positive for Banned Substance

Doping scandals have become a part of the Olympics and this year is no different. According to International Testing Agency, Russian skater Kamila Valieva failed the doping test. On further examination, she tested positive for a performance-enhancing banned substance. She was told that she could not train, compete and participate during the Olympic Winter Games.

However, due to some miscommunication, she was allowed to be a participant in the team figure skating competition. She led the team to win gold but the medal is yet to be awarded due to the big confusion regarding the timeline of her drug test, suspension order, and miscommunication. The issue has become a controversial Beijing winter Olympics highlights.
