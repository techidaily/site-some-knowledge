### Key Takeaways

* The Roborock Dyad Pro is a wet and dry vacuum cleaner specifically designed for flat surfaces, with powerful suction and self-cleaning and drying capabilities.
* The machine was well-made and easy to use, with a long battery life and easy maintenance. However, it could be difficult to place in the charging stand, and the accompanying app was not very useful.
* While the Dyad Pro offers numerous advantages, including its powerful specs, it may not be worth the high price point for everyone. It is best suited for users with high foot traffic and non-carpeted surfaces.

 The [Roborock Dyad Pro](https://www.amazon.com/roborock-Vanquish-DyadPower-Self-Cleaning-Dispenser/dp/B0BL873KHD/?tag=htg-v2-vgb1cpl-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Froborock-dyad-pro-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is the company's only non-robotic vacuum cleaner. It has both wet and dry capabilities and offers a variety of benefits, but also comes with some negatives, including its high price point. After a month of extensive testing, I can see how it could be useful to a specific group of usersâ€”but not everyone.

 Robots have become popular for home cleaning, but upright vacuums still have their place. Even the best robot vacuums, like the [Roborock S7 Max Ultra](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/fixed-cannot-insert-object-error-in-excel-2007-step-by-step-guide-by-stellar-guide/) with built-in mops, can miss larger messes on flat surfaces, which is where something like the Roborock Dyad Pro can play a role.

 Companies such as Bissell, Ecovacs, Dreametech, and Roborock are manufacturing attractive and powerful vacuum cleaners that can be used for both wet and dry cleaning. However, they are limited to flat surfaces, which may make purchasing one unjustifiable. If you are in the target market, however, the Roborock Dyad Pro is worth considering due to its numerous advantages.

##  Powerful Specs: Solid Machine, Easy to Find Parts

 The weight of the Dyad Pro box caught my attention, as it weighed in at 23lbs. The robot itself weighs 10lbs, which didn't feel like a lot when using it. It has dimensions of 12.2x10.6x43.7in, which is something of a large size.

 The Dyad Pro comes mostly assembled, with only the handle requiring insertion into the vacuum body; this was a seamless process that took about 10 seconds. The included drying and charging dock should be placed near a wall socket, ideally in a closet, to avoid taking up too much space. You should fully charge the cleaner before first use. My unit came with a 65% charge, so testing began quickly.

 When placing the Dyad Pro in its charger for the first time, be careful as the machine is slightly bottom-heavy. This was surprising when lifting it up, but it wasn't a problem during use. The weight distribution actually made it feel like a solid machine. However, it took some getting used to when lifting it in and out of the charger.

 The Dyad Pro has two water tanks: a 900ml clean tank and a 770ml dirty tank. Both were easy to remove using their easy-to-find release buttons. The machine also comes with a small cleaning solution dispenser that works with any detergent. The company suggests using its own Roborock Floor Cleaning Solution for Vacuum Mops so I purchased that separately through Amazon for my tests. The dispenser automatically mixes the detergent with clean water while in use. Roborock claims that a cartridge of clean solution can provide up to 20 tanks of clean water or 600 minutes of continuous use. This sounds about right, although I didn't actually test the machine for what amounts to 10 hours.

 There are three rollers on the bottom of the cleaner: one full-length roller for cleaning both sides of the floor and two smaller front rollers for sweeping up messes with margins less than 1mm. Put together, the three rollers promise (and delivered) edge-to-edge cleaning. There's also a splash guard that you can adjust to raise and lower, depending on the size of waste on the floor. It's another nice touch that's missing on similar products.

##  Operation: The Good and Bad

![Showing a closeup of the Roborock Dyad Pro's LED with the machine standing upright in a kitchen on hardwood floor](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/roborock-dyad-pro-led.jpeg)

 On the top of the Dyad Pro is a circular LED displaying crucial information, such as the remaining charging percentage, and icons indicating whether the clean tank is empty or the dirty tank is full. Around the LED, you'll find a digital indicator that displays the real-time dirt level. The level changes between the color red and blue depending on how dirty the floor is.

 The LED screen also shows whether you're using the ECO, MAX, or AUTO mode, or Floor Drying Mode. I'd suggest sticking with AUTO mode, which allows the machine to adjust the suction power depending on what it finds on the floor with its sensors. With 17000Pa of suction power, the Dyad Pro has no problem cleaning up wet and dry messes, and I see no reason to worry about switching modes.

 Roborock's Floor Drying Mode is designed to remove clean water from wet areas like bathrooms. It is limited to one minute of use before it resumes AUTO mode. However, during my tests, I didn't notice any significant difference, so it may not be worth using. Moreover, the Dyad Pro didn't use a lot of water during its operation, meaning the floor didn't take long to dry regardless.

 The Dyad Pro also has three buttons at the top of the handle. On the front side (and away from the user) are the power and change mode buttons. The former can act as a power, off, and pause button. The latter button is used to switch between AUTO, MAX, Floor Drying, and ECO modes. Again, stick with AUTO and save yourself some headaches.

 On the back of the handle is the self-cleaning button. The Dyad Pro can clean itself in standard or deep mode, but only while it's in the charging dock. During self-cleaning, the rollers use alternating scrubbing and are then automatically dried. The Dyad Pro's self-cleaning feature worked as advertised, eliminating the need to manually clean the dirty rollers. Perfect.

###  About the sounds

 Robot vacuums have become quieter in recent years, but upright vacuums that require manual operation remain noisy due to their suction power. The Dyad Pro was no exception, as it was very loud during normal operation. However, the limited range of the machine meant that I could only use it in my kitchen, which is a small space compared to the rest of my home, where there's carpet. It's important to note that the Dyad Pro is not suitable for use on carpets.

 The voice alerts on the Dyad Pro were not loud enough and got drowned out by the vacuuming noise, causing unnecessary distraction. With the LED display showing all the necessary controls, there really is no need for the machine to speak. You can glance at the panel and quickly see all the available options and settings. The bottom line: the voice is simply unnecessary and terribly executed. You can turn the voice volume down, however, to remove it.

##  Maintenance: It's So Easy

 The Dyad Pro's built-in self-cleaning function removes many unpleasant maintenance stepsâ€”but not all of them. You still need to add fresh water and (ugh) remove the dirty water regularly. And yes, that nasty water can smell bad and include all those pieces of dirt you were happy the vacuum had picked up earlier! The dirty tank also consists of a plastic filter that must be cleaned. (The machine comes with a maintenance brush for this purpose.) Regardless, the Dyad Pro was easy to clean.

##  About the App: A Worthless Addition

![Three screenshots showing the Roborock app highlighting a Dyad Pro](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/roborock-dyad-pro-app.jpg) 

Bryan M. Wolfe / How-To Geek

 Robot vacuums are more efficient with a mobile app for controlling their movements. However, as an upright, the Dyad Pro is manually operated, which makes the app significantly less useful. In fact, the Roborock app, in this case, appeared to be a marketing gimmick, at best.

 During the actual cleaning process, the app provided no extra benefits over what I could do using the buttons on the actual machine. When the Dyad Pro is not in use, you can perform a few tasks, although none of them seem all that useful. For example, you can activate self-cleaning from the app, as well as the suction force and water level. You can also tell the machine to turn off its LED screen during certain hours in a Do Not Disturb feature few will find useful.

 I'll give Roborock points for offering app integration with the Dyad Pro. However, how the machine must be operated severely limits its usefulness.

##  Should You Buy the Roborock Dyad Pro?

 The [Roborock Dyad Pro](https://www.amazon.com/roborock-Vanquish-DyadPower-Self-Cleaning-Dispenser/dp/B0BL873KHD/?tag=htg-v2-vgb1cpl-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Froborock-dyad-pro-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is a costly machine, which must be calculated into whether or not to purchase it. Yes, it worked as expected and did a remarkable job of keeping flat surfaces clean. However, that cost is even more noticeable because its use is limited to only flat surfaces that you can clean with water.

 The perfect buyer for the Dyad Pro is someone with a kitchen that involves a lot of foot traffic, perhaps by people and pets alike. Throw in a location that experiences a lot of rain (and snow) that's easily brought into the home, and the benefits certainly outweigh the cost. If however, your home doesn't see a lot of foot traffic and non-carpet surfaces are limited, there's little reason to invest in this type of machine.
