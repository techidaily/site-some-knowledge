### No.5 Deego

Degoo is a cloud storage service that focuses heavily on consumers and is primarily concerned with photos and videos.

In direct opposition to Degoo Cloud, Google Photos, Apple Photos, and other services have been incorporating features of this kind.

With only a web app available for the desktop, Degoo Cloud relies heavily on its apps for Android and iOS. There are also apps for Samsung and Huawei app. Although the service has few features, it's worth looking at if you need a place to store your photos.

It is much more than most websites offer, whether 10 GB, 1 TB, or 100 TB. You can save an almost unlimited amount in your account, but you won't miss out on any extraordinary features.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)
