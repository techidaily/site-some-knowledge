Within last few months, the New York Time is boosting and expanding all its online and print stories that are working with its specially designed VR app. It is designed to work with Google Cardboards and give awesome results at output. The best part to know is that it comes with smartphone viewing mode and sad thing is that you need to buy Google Cardboards to run this app. Available for free.
