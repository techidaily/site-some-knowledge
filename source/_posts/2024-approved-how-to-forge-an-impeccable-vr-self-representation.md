## Part 1: What is an Avatar?

Generally, an avatar refers to an icon or figure representing a person in a video game, social media platform, etc. In other words, a representation of you on the internet. When Metaverse Avatar comes about, think of an icon representing you in the VR (Virtual Reality). Therefore, as technical experts talk of Metaverse, an avatar is equally essential. Why? Because it is what you use to identify yourself in the digital world.

Think of it in the sense of how you go about opening a social media account. Typically, you will upload your photo as a visual representation of yourself on the platform. The same case happens when dealing with Metaverse; you need an avatar. However, in this case, you don't need your real photo since you settle for a figure where you dress it and design it as per your taste and preference.

As mentioned above, Metaverse is a technological evolution aiming to blend various platforms such as video games and social media and allow people to interact with each other efficiently. Reports show that experts often mention Metaverse and avatars hand in hand. In other words, they feature a dependent relationship. You probably don't understand why avatars are crucial in Metaverse when you think of the two. And this is the area that this section wishes to address.

What is the importance of Avatars for the Metaverse community? Avatars refer to various individuals' representations when dealing with the digital world. In simple terms, you use an avatar in place of you in the virtual world. Avatar Metaverse gives the users a sense of identity while navigating through the internet. With the help of an avatar, you express your identity to the online community.

However, note that the critical feature in Avatars that makes it extremely important in Metaverse is interoperability is the ability for the avatars to communicate between various platforms easily. For example, when you buy things for your Avatar, this feature allows you to move around multiple online platforms with these changes. Avatars in Metaverse give a sense of togetherness in the virtual world.
