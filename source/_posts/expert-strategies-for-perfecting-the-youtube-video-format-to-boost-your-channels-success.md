## YouTube Supported Video Formats

If you want to upload the videos you shot to YouTube, the first thing you need to know is what video formats YouTube support. Even though YouTube accepts a variety of video formats, including HEVC/H.265, there are still some video formats being booted out. Below are the best video formats supported by YouTube.

![best video format for youtube](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/best-ytb-video-format.jpg)

• MP4 (a multimedia container format standard specified as a part of MPEG-4)  
 • FLV (Flash Video, a kind of video format)  
 • AVI (Audio Video Interleaved,a kind of video format)  
 • MOV (the QuickTime multimedia file format)  
 • 3GPP (A multimedia container format defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for 3G UMTS multimedia services.)  
 • MPEG4 (A method of defining compression of audio and visual digital data developed by the Moving Picture Experts Group)  
 • WMV (Windows Media Video)  
 • MPEGPS (A data container associated with the MPEG program stream format, which is used for multiplexing digital audio, video and more.)  
 • WebM (A video file format primarily intended to offer a royalty-free alternative to use in the HTML5 video tag.)  
 • [HEVC](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) (High Efficiency Video Coding, or H.265\. Compared to H.264, HEVC offers up to 50% bit rate saving at the same quality, which makes it perfect for 4K video). 

It's stated by YouTube that MP4 is the best format for uploading. It provides better quality than FLV and is not as heavy as AVI. WMV HD format seems to lose its quality while 3GPP and MPEG-PS resolutions are too small.

To know more details about the best YouTube video file format and get a better [setting for YouTube videos uploading](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), please follow the table directly below this summary.

### 1\. Best YouTube Video Format

Resolution: Recommended 1280 x 720 (16:9 HD) and 640 x 480 (4:3 SD). There is no required minimum resolution – in general the higher resolution the better and HD resolution is preferred. For older content, lower resolution is unavoidable. It's discouraged to add horizontal black bars before uploading a video to YouTube. If you do it, black bars will be all around your video and it will look rather horrible.

Bitrate: As bitrate highly rests upon codec, there is no recommendation or minimum value. You are suggested to optimize video for resolution, aspect ratio and frame rate rather than bitrate.

Frame rate: If it's possible, you'd better keep an original frame rate. Usually videos have the best quality if the frame rate is between 25-30 fps. Some modern cameras give even 2000 fps, but YouTube doesn't support such a quality yet. Particularly, pulldown and other frame rate resampling techniques are strongly discouraged. 

Codec: H.264, MPEG-2 or MPEG-4 preferred. These codecs are used in most modern videos, so you'll hardly need to change this parameter.

### 2\. Best YouTube Audio Format

Codec: MP3 or AAC preferred

Sampling rate: 44.1kHz sampling rate and the higher bitrate possible, but no less than 192 kbps

Channels: 2 (stereo)
