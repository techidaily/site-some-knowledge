## Part 3: Related FAQs

### 1\. How do I make a meme text post?

Any of the above methodology can be used to the creation of text memes. You may use a meme generator to generate the meme by opening it, choosing a template of a solid color, and then adding text. If you write in your text, it will become a meme that only exists in text. Because these tools are skilled at modifying media, it is possible to do it on both [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and IMGFlip, where making memes is simple. Unlike Filmora, which offers an endless number of meme-making options, IMGFlip has certain limitations.

### 2\. How do I add an image to IMGFlip?

The IMGFlip meme generator is a flexible tool with many applications. By uploading customized photos and making use of all the modification tools, you may produce a range of creative works, such as posters, banners, advertisements, and other standout graphics.

### 3\. What is the best meme generator?

From the discussion above, we may infer that [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) triumphs because it provides free services that IMGFlip does not. The IMGFlip has many great features and is compatible with a variety of operating systems, but compared to Filmora, its monthly membership rate of up to $9.95 is just too exorbitant. Also, Filmora Meme Generator is free despite the fact that IMGFlip provides amazing enhancements like as improved video frame rate, no-watermark, and greater processing speed upon membership. Because of a number of its user-friendly features, this program provides straightforward communication with the audience.

## Conclusion

Online resources are widely accessible for creating memes. The fact that IMGFlip is a well-known tool that can handle media files and is simple to use is also evident from this article. Even though it costs money, IMGFlip is a really helpful tool. The services offered by IMGFlip are quite good. But since it provides a wide variety of features and skills for free, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is far better. But when taken into account in a larger sense, both technologies are effective and simple to use. Either tool may be used to do a broad range of tasks by both beginners and specialists. Whether IMGFlip or Filmora are utilized for the project, the results will be desired.
