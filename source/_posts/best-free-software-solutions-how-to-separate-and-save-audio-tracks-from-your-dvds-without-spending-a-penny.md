## Method 4\. Rip Audio from DVD with HandBrake

**Compatible OS:** Windows, Mac, Linux

**Supported DVDs:** home-made DVDs

**Cons:**

* It rips un-encrypted DVDs only.
* It needs an additional tool to convert video output to audio format.

Here are the steps to follow:

To convert video to audio with VLC, simply follow these steps:
