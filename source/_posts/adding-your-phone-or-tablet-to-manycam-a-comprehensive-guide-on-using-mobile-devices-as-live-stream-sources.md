### Application support & features

Note 

 With this feature, you will only be able to view your mobile device from your desktop, not the other way around. 

Unlike the desktop version, ManyCam for mobile is not designed to connect with browsers or other apps, like Instagram, WhatsApp, Viber, etc due to limitations of the mobile operating systems (iOS, Android), therefore ManyCam for mobile is limited to RTMP streaming only and it also offers a limited number of features and effects compared to ManyCam for Desktop.  
  
If you want to connect to other apps and services and use custom effects and [various video streaming features](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/) like virtual background and lower thirds, try out our desktop app, which you can download for free at [manycam.com.](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/)
