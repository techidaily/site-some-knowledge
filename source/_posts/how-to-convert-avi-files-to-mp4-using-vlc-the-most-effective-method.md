![note icon](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../image-style/new-seo/icon0.png)

this test is conducted on a 27-inch iMac (Early 2011), powered by 2.70GHz Intel Core i5 4 Core and Yosemite operating system.

From this table, you can clearly see the big gap between free VLC player and MacX Video Converter Pro in conversion speed. VLC has no advanced acceleration technologies to speed up video conversion. Actually, we can understand. After all, VLC is a free open source video player. Its developer team lacks enough time and financial support to constantly update its product with advanced tech. This is a different story for MacX AVI converter. It has professional developer team and support team to instantly collect users urgent needs and put in larg amount of time and money to arm this app with high-end [Intel QSV](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and multi-core CPU utility. Because customer comes first is their service tenent. 

Okay, how about the output file size? Why VLC output file is expanded from 80MB to 132.5 MB? One simple reason: VLC for Mac version actually doesn't support H264 codec. Though we select H264 codec in VLC player, the output file is still encoded by MPEG-4\. And that can explain why the output MP4 file can reach 132.5 MB in file size. BTW: MacX Video Converter Pro can help you [compress AVI files](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) if you need to upload AVI to YouTube/Facebook or transfer to mobile devices.

For Windows users, don't worry. The following part shows you the specific performances of VLC and MacX Video Converter Pro on Windows PC.

The test result on Windows has no big difference from that on Mac computer.
