 After selecting the destination folder and adjusting the settings, click on the OK button and wait for the pictures to be transferred to your PC.

### Method 2: Using iTunes to transfer pictures and videos to a PC

 Transferring photos from an iPhone to a PC with iTunes requires you to have this software installed on both devices. If this is the case, you should connect your iPhone to a PC with a USB cable, but before you do make sure that all files you want to transfer are located in the same folder on your iPhone.

### Method 3: Transferring iPhone photos via iCloud to a PC

 Besides being remarkably simple this method of transferring photos from iPhone to PC will also save you a lot of time. If your PC and iPhone are connected through the iCloud service, each time you take a photo with your phone a copy of it will be saved on your computer, if you are connected to Wi-Fi. If you are not connected to the Internet at the moment when you are taking the picture, all photos will be automatically transferred the next time you connect your iPhone to Wi-Fi.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icloud-photo-from-iphone-to-pc.jpg)

 You need to enable iCloud service on your iPhone in your phone's Settings menu and enable the Photo Stream option in order to start backing up your photos on a PC. Afterwards, you should install the iCloud Control Panel on your computer and two devices should be synced-in. However, transferring your videos with iCloud is not an option, and photos taken before this service was activated will not be automatically transferred. Despite this iCloud is an extremely simple and efficient way to back up all of your photos, and make sure that you can always have enough free space on your iPhone to take amazing photos.

### Method 2: Using iTunes to transfer pictures and videos to a PC

 Transferring photos from an iPhone to a PC with iTunes requires you to have this software installed on both devices. If this is the case, you should connect your iPhone to a PC with a USB cable, but before you do make sure that all files you want to transfer are located in the same folder on your iPhone.

 Open the software on your PC and click on the iPhone icon in the menu located in the upper left corner of the iTunes. The Settings menu will appear on the left side of your screen and you should click on the Photo tab. At the top of the screen, you'll be able to see the Sync Photo checkbox, click on it and then select the folder from the drop-down menu.

 Locate the folder on your iPhone in which images you want to sync are located and select them. Once you've selected all pictures you want to transfer click on the Apply button located at the lower right corner of your screen. The duration of the transfer depends on the version of the Windows you have, and the transfer may be slow on some older versions of the OS.

### Method 3: Transferring iPhone photos via iCloud to a PC

 Besides being remarkably simple this method of transferring photos from iPhone to PC will also save you a lot of time. If your PC and iPhone are connected through the iCloud service, each time you take a photo with your phone a copy of it will be saved on your computer, if you are connected to Wi-Fi. If you are not connected to the Internet at the moment when you are taking the picture, all photos will be automatically transferred the next time you connect your iPhone to Wi-Fi.

 You need to enable iCloud service on your iPhone in your phone's Settings menu and enable the Photo Stream option in order to start backing up your photos on a PC. Afterwards, you should install the iCloud Control Panel on your computer and two devices should be synced-in. However, transferring your videos with iCloud is not an option, and photos taken before this service was activated will not be automatically transferred. Despite this iCloud is an extremely simple and efficient way to back up all of your photos, and make sure that you can always have enough free space on your iPhone to take amazing photos.
