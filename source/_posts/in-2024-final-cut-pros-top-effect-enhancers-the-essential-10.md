## Part 1\. Best Final Cut Pro Plug-Ins

### 1\. Fx factory pro

Fx factory pro is one of the **best final cut pro plug ins** that users can try for free to access if the plug-in is suited to their video editing work. But while using the trials, fx factory pro would watermark the video, although, after purchase, it gets removed. Users can easily download it from the Fx factory website, and its smooth layout will help you quickly navigate its homepage.

![fx factory pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/fx-factory-pro.jpg)

If you are thinking about fx factory pro integration with **fcpx plug-ins**, you need not worry about that because the coordination between the two is off-charts. Many professionals looking for video editing websites consider Fx factory as their ideal destination for choosing plug-ins for their work.

### 2\. mLUT

Are you not satisfied with final cut pro X color grading software even though you don't necessarily hate it but want to see improvements in it? That's where the mLUT plug-in of motion VFX comes into the picture. Ideally, it is a free plug-in that video editors can use to look up their tables in one place together.

The black hole feature offered would drag your video image to a single location or point, and the Bulge feature would add an inward or outward bulge to the image.

And lastly, the twirl effect twists your clip to a certain degree to move it from subtle to extreme points.

Finally, the last one on our list is the shutter shock FCPX plug-in, which needed to be included, or the list would be considered incomplete for starters.

The black hole feature offered would drag your video image to a single location or point, and the Bulge feature would add an inward or outward bulge to the image.
