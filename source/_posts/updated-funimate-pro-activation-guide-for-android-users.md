## 3\. How to Use Funimate Pro

Funimate allows users to follow people on the site, so they are always in touch with strangers. Parents should check their child's buddy list regularly to monitor activities. Overall, Funimate is a fun tool for kids to experiment with video editing and be creative, but parents should keep an eye on their child's privacy settings and interactions while using the app. The editor itself is pretty straightforward to use. To use the editor like an expert, though, you may watch lessons in the upper left corner of the screen or take a cue from the sample video in your document.

### Steps to Use Funimate Pro

_Step 1:_ Simply choose any movie from the app that you wish to utilize, and then select the needed photographs by granting the app access to your gallery. That's all there is to it. You now have a terrific template that will show off your picture video tale in seconds.

_Step 4:_ If you wish to edit the images you've already taken, you may do so by choosing each one individually in the editing window. In addition, by pressing the download button, you may change the music from the default and download a movie.

_Step 5:_ At the end, you can also add saturation, exposure, highlight, shadow, ambiance, grain, temperature, fade, blur, and brightness are among the photo-editing capabilities included in the application. In addition, depending on your needs, you may add text to the image, as well as audio, narration, and a mixer into a clip.
