## Illusory Journeys Through Time and Dimensions

Always been curious about using time travel devices but have found no solution? This article lets you know the whole process of how you can activate a time travelling teleportation device using clever filming and editing in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Before filming and editing a video, get to know about the time-travel teleportation device.

## Part 1\. What Is a Time Travel Teleportation Device?

Teleportation is usually estimated as the travelling between two points which carries unlimited time to complete. It's always considered impossible to make time travel devices and use them in real life.

However, in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) the time travelling teleportation devices are real. It just needs some DIY filming hacks and an editing tool. Let's start to take shots and get into it.

## Part 2\. Filming Prerequisites for Time Travelling Effects

To create shots, we have to do two processing rounds. In the first round, we will film a shot for daytime activity. While in the next round, we will shoot a video for nighttime activity. Get straight into the filming mode and create according to your script.

### #1 daylight lighting setup

In this round, you have to create a daytime action, implying that you need daylight. As well as, you don't need professional filming skills because it is going to be so simple.

Catch us at the below tips to make your video shots more skilled! First, you need a Lightning set, in which blue light is used to film the first shot. Because in this shot, we need daylight, and as you know, blue-ish lighting is usually used to intimate the daylight.

You can also use a light that is 5,600 kelvins, which indicates blue light. We can easily change the light from its remote, as shown below.

![blue light lighting setup](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/blue-light-lighting-setup.jpg)

If you don't have an asset to get the lighting set up, then don't worry; we have another option.

**Make colorful shots with plastic binders**

Professional videographers create these effects using high-end lighting. But you don't have to buy any pricey equipment. Because colored plastic binder dividers or cellophane wrapping can be used to easily create colorful photos.

First, wrap the colorful divider around the LED light or any other light you're using to take video. The dividers will be melt or burn when the light source gets too hot; therefore, check the temperature of the light after short gaps.

![wrap the led light with a plastic binder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/wrap-the-led-light-with-a-plastic-binder.jpg)

* Shoot the video now, and experiment with adding suspense, terror, and cheerful effects with various colors.

![final results after changing led light by colorful binders](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-results-after-changing-led-light-by-colorful-binders.jpg)

After setting the lights, now it's time to check the camera!

**Camera alignment**

It is a very important step that you don't have to change the camera position during filming. Because if the camera angle will not be same, it's difficult to show in the same alignment during editing.

![camera alignment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/camera-alignment.gif)

After setting all equipment, now it's time to allow the character to perform in front of the camera.

**Character position**

For the first round, the subject has to do acting for the daytime script. Let the character do their performance according to the screenplay.

In this article, we are doing a daytime performance in the first round. For this, the subject should go from right to left to step over for night time dimension.

### #1 night-time lighting setup

In the second round, you have to create a nighttime action indicating that you need a night light. You have to change the costume of a subject as well as you can change the set too.

To film a night mode, you need a warmer light, which is used to make shots for the second round. You can also use a light that is under 2700-3000 kelvins because it indicates warm light.

![night time warmer light](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/night-time-warmer-light.jpg)

You don't need to worry if you don't have enough budget to get this setup. Because plastic binders will make your way easy, and you can create your own at home, as told earlier.

**Character performance**

For the second round, the subject has to change the costume according to nighttime. Then the character has to perform according to the script.

In this round, the subject should start from the right to left and perform stepping over to the nighttime dimension. This action should remain on the left side of the crossline.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure to match the **"stepping over"** of the character for better results in the transition video.

### #3 cross line between two rounds

For a transition, you have to insert a line between two rounds. It will identify the difference between the two timelines. We will use the middle line of the frame as a cross line for reference in this article.

You can also create a marking by using anything in yours. We are using the midline of the sofa for marking the cross line, as shown below. This will also make a lot of help during editing on [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
