## Part 2: Extended Knowledge about M4V

[**What is M4V format**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) \- An M4V file is an MPEG-4 video file, or sometimes called an iTunes video file, which is most commonly used in the movies, TV shows, music videos, and other video contents downloaded from iTunes Store. The M4V may be protected with Apple's FairPlay Digital Rights Management (DRM), which limits the playback of M4V files to only authorized computers and iOS devices. And unprotected M4V files can be played on most devices and players. The M4V files ripped from DVD normally do not contain DRM. 

[**M4V VS MP4**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) \- M4V and MP4 are almost identical. Like MP4, M4V is also based on MPEG-4, but it uses AVC video compression. MP4 is more widely used for internet distribution and streaming, while M4V is specially designed for Apple products like iPhone, iPad, iTunes store, Apple TV, QuickTime Player, iMovie, Final Cut Pro etc. Though, as M4V is becoming popular, more and more player, devices and software have the support for M4V format. Besides, m4v is often copyrighted via Apple's FairPlay DRM copyright protection. In other words, if you want to play the file freely, convert the DVD to MP4; and if you want to play the DVD on Apple devices or computer players, then free rip DVD to M4V.
