##### Step2 Perform Professional Video Editing

To modify a video, right-click it and choose edit from the menu. The video may then be rotated by selecting the appropriate effects button. Depending on your needs, you may also rotate 90 degrees in either a clockwise or anticlockwise direction, flip level, or go vertical. In that case, then. A number of visual effects may also be added, and the best thing is that you can utilize others from the standard library as well, giving you more flexibility in where you place them.

##### Step4 Save or Share the Videos

At the end of your editing journey, you may use the complete Filmora editor as previously mentioned when you've done editing the recorded video.

## Conclusion

With Internet’s evolution, it was difficult to predict the transformative effects these technologies would have on our entertainment, journalism, and companies. Windows Movie Maker 6.0 was the first program used in the production of YouTube videos. But today, Wondershare has the fulcrum of sound and video tools using its flagship product [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It works well for beginners and intermediate users so you won’t have any hurdles using it to the full extent.
