## & USB4 11-in-1 Hub - A Closer Look at the HDMI 2.1 Absence

### Key Takeaways

* Plugable's Thunderbolt 4 docking station offers ample I/O, including three Thunderbolt 4 ports and 96W of certified charging.
* The lack of HDMI 2.1 support is a major drawback, limiting display output to 4K60 or 8K30.
* The sleek design, aluminum construction, and included 1-meter Thunderbolt 4 cable and HDMI adapter make it a convenient and aesthetically pleasing choice for Apple users.

 Plugable’s latest [Thunderbolt 4 & USB4 Docking Station](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFC9CR5W?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001020&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fplugable-thunderbolt-4-dock-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), an 11-in-1 solution, could be a solid choice for the macOS-powered desk. While it’s compatible with Windows, this docking station focuses on the Apple crowd with multiple Thunderbolt 4 ports and up to 96W of certified charging power. Delivering HDMI 2.0 support for standard monitors up to 4K60 or 8K30, you’ll find the three Thunderbolt 4 and ample additional I/O ports that are perfect for hooking up your dual displays, 2.5G ethernet, your keyboard and mouse, as well as an NVMe-based SSD all through a single cable. It's all great, but it comes at a price.

##  No HDMI 2.1 Is a Major Letdown

![The Plugable Thunderbolt 4 set up with a laptop and monitor](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/the-plugable-thunderbolt-4-set-up-with-a-laptop-and-monitor_53296845222_o.jpg)

 Let's get the bad out of the way first. Plugable’s Thunderbolt 4 dock is pretty well-suited for the high-end desk setup except for its lack of HDMI 2.1 support. While Plugable has a USB4 dock that packs dual HDMI 2.1 ports, each capable of 4K120 output, and other companies are [putting dual HDMI 2.1 ports on their docks](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-video-construction-lab/), Plugable's latest Thunderbolt 4 hub only supports up to 4K60 or 8K30\. This is a bit of a letdown when you consider how many 4K120 monitors are on the market today. Being locked to 4K60 could be considered a pretty big drawback for many. However, if you have a 1440p144 display at your desk, or simply stick to 60Hz at higher resolutions, then you’ll find this drawback very minimal indeed.

##  Hook Up Everything but the Kitchen Sink to Your Computer Through a Single Cable

![Power button and lights on the Plugable Thunderbolt 4](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/power-button-and-lights-on-the-plugable-thunderbolt-4_53298090974_o.jpg)

 Outside of the HDMI being 2.0, you’ll find the rest of the I/O on Plugable’s Thunderbolt 4 dock to be pretty robust. For starters, there’s a total of four USB-A 10Gbps ports here, which is pretty good compared to other Thunderbolt 4 docks out there. This gives you plenty of ports to hook up a mouse, keyboard, printer, and headset all straight to the dock without anything else needed.

 In addition to the USB-A plug on the front, you’ll find that there’s a UHS-II SD card slot paired with a combo audio jack. These are joined by the host Thunderbolt 4 port which delivers up to 96W of certified charging power, which is enough for even the [M3 Max 14-inch MacBook Pro](https://solve-manuals.techidaily.com/cookiebot-driven-personalization-enhancing-your-sites-user-experience/). However, in practical use of this dock, I still wish Thunderbolt 4 dock manufacturers would find a way to put the host port on the back, like Thunderbolt 3 docks of yesteryear. It would be much more practical to have the main plug on the back for a cleaner setup.

 Around the back (where the host port _should_ be), you’ll find two more Thunderbolt 4 ports capable of 40Gbps bandwidth and up to 15W charging, the remaining three USB-A 10Gbps plugs, 2.5G ethernet, and the HDMI 2.0 output. All-in-all, this dock does allow you to have an entire desk plugged in, including two displays, thanks to the bundled USB-C to HDMI adapter. If you’re looking for a way to simplify your desk setup down to a single cable, this could be a fantastic solution.

##  A Sleek Design Pairs Well With Apple’s Space Gray Computers

 The overall design of Plugable’s Thunderbolt 4 dock is sophisticated, yet understated. The overall color scheme paired perfectly with my M1 Max MacBook Pro in Space Gray, and I loved the aesthetic overall. The black front and back blend seamlessly with my desk, and the finned cooling design on the side is a nice touch. Those with an Apple computer will likely love the aesthetic, and if you have a Windows-based setup, it’ll still look great sitting on your desk, though the color might not match quite as perfectly as it does with Apple’s computers.

 This dock also boasts a quality feel thanks to the majority of the parts being made out of aluminum. There’s a nice heft to it, and you won’t find the dock sliding around when plugging in your laptop unless you really pull on it.

##  The Included 1M Thunderbolt 4 Cable and HDMI to USB-C Adapter Is a Nice Touch

 In times past, when buying Thunderbolt docks, I always had to buy a separate cable because the included one was typically just 0.3 meters long. Well, Plugable went the extra mile here—rightfully so, for the price—and includes a 1-meter cable to hook your laptop up with.

 This is actually a really nice touch and makes powering your setup with this docking station that much easier right out of the box. In addition to a nice Thunderbolt 4 cable, Plugable also includes one of its own USB-C to HDMI adapters in the package. This lets you leverage dual displays right out of the box, without having to buy anything else. While it would have been nice to see a second HDMI port on the dock itself, this is a better resolution than making you buy the adapter separately.

##  Should You Buy the Plugable Thunderbolt 4 Dock?

 Coming in with a list price of $290, the [Plugable Thunderbolt 4 & USB4 Docking Station](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFC9CR5W?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001020&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fplugable-thunderbolt-4-dock-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is anything but cheap. While there are some more expensive Thunderbolt 4 docks on the market, Plugable is definitely hitting high in the pricing market. With all the ports that it offers and the included 1-meter Thunderbolt 4 cable, you’re still getting a good amount of value for the price.

 However, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that you could still go with a dock from Plugable, save about $90, and get dual HDMI 2.1 outputs at the same time. In doing so, you’d lose out on all the Thunderbolt 4 goodness though, including the two rear 40Gbps ports. So, if you need those, then this dock is worth the $90 premium over [Plugable’s more affordable USB4 dock](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C83ZMZG5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001020&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fplugable-thunderbolt-4-dock-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate).

 In the end, Plugable’s Thunderbolt 4 docking station offers ample I/O and great build quality, though it does land itself on the higher end of the pricing spectrum.
