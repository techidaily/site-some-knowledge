##  How to Reset a Google TV Remote

 If you've tried pairing and unpairing with no success, the last resort is a factory reset. This will rest the remote to it's original factory settings. Since it's just a remote, you don't really have to worry about losing anything during this process.

 First, remove the batteries from the remote and wait five minutes. After five minutes have passed, hold down the Home button and reinsert the batteries. Continue to hold the Home button while the LED light stays solid. Release the button when the light begins to blink.

##  Try the Google TV Remote on Your Phone

 One of the cool things about an internet-connected streaming device is the ability to use your phone as a remote control. If your Google TV's physical remote is giving you trouble, you can always switch over to the virtual remote. Both the [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-tv-watch-movies-tv/id746894884) and [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004531/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.videos&hl=en%5FUS) devices can do this with the official Google TV app—open the app and tap the floating "TV Remote" button in the bottom corner.
