For people who get used to this popular file downloading add-on may stick to it and reluctant to turn to Orbit Downloader alternative. So the segment will focus on some dark sidesthe tool may have.

Even worse, it failed to show GetIt button anywhere, either in Internet Explorer or Chrome.

4\. Perhaps the fatal blow is malware. According to ESET, an anti-virus company, it includes code that's used to perform DDos attacks targeting other computers and serves. Worse still, the installation may be accompanied with other adware, freeware or malware that may change your default search engines and even lead to damage of your computer.
