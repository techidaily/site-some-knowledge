 TikTok Shop opened for business in November 2022, and the operation now generates more than $17 billion per year. Almost anyone can monetize their TikTok account using Shopify—which is how I got burned. Here's what you need to know to make sure it doesn't happen to you.

##  A Tale of Two TikTok Purchases

 I was a latecomer to [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) and if I'm being honest, I only got on board for clumsy panda content with a side of funny memes. I didn't plan to use it as a shopping platform.

 But who can resist the siren song of clothing and criss-cross chairs? Not me, apparently. Since I signed up for TikTok, I've made two purchases: a [viral oversized desk chair](https://www.amazon.com/Legged-Office-Armless-Computer-Adjustable/dp/B0CZLHFWL8/ref=sr%5F1%5F5?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EYKqMjOnndRP7MShUqmOzZBgiPBKdwLlhpHETWBE2TO1s4a%5FiOHgexUu2sVrgA9MXTSiXV9ZdJx0%5Ftrvxq5caahoQAsYRLYi1BqnuR8KPv35286n7TBo0LYhksIhy3XgMIel5N1KvOUD7n8u4vry3KKSwTnmVF1hNHd3BEsWLqNX8EkeCC4%5FBjv5DF9jhNY1WTa3V8UDQdjPom8JEs26qD90ov-JewAEEIkAhYjz9JF7y621lAtnYpU8pQ6DqLNLTffBvck5gF8mtuNbr2vY0MxZPB3gRpnRf6LJ1teMrFM.fAmGlb014eQcxe5m1moZZ8MJENJo-Do1bOpdVSR6rb4&dib%5Ftag=se&hvadid=665639400447&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1013462&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=6948836597444604577&hvtargid=kwd-2162749065788&hydadcr=7665%5F13469258&keywords=viral+criss+cross+chair&qid=1718305400&sr=8-5&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003634&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fi-got-burned-shopping-on-tiktok-but-you-can-learn-from-my-mistake%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and a [belted black jumpsuit](https://mccoyn.com/products/womens-sleeveless-wide-leg-jumpsuit). I sit upon my huge quilted throne as we speak, but the jumpsuit is lost to time and space (I got scammed out of $20).

 While the chair sale went through the typical TikTok Shop Shopify pipeline, at some point when purchasing the jumpsuit I was apparently lured to a third-party site. When the item never arrived and I requested a refund, I was met with radio silence. I'm not holding my breath.

##  How TikTok Shop Works

 TikTokers sell items in two different ways. If they want to sell an original product, they can set up a TikTok Shop in their account by way of Shopify. To qualify in the U.S., users must have a TikTok for Business account, an online store with a return policy, and [set up a shop on their Shopify admin page](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-sales-channels/tiktok/setup).

 Influencers can also sign up for the affiliate program. When they do this, they can choose from available links presented by product creators and make a video about that product. The TikTok influencer will earn a small commission for every product sold through their unique link.

 For shoppers, the process is a lot easier. You can go to the Shop icon at the bottom of your TikTok screen to browse products:

 Or, you can click the Shop link in a video to shop for the product that they're talking about:

##  Red Flags When Buying on TikTok

 If you want to learn from my mistake, here are some red flags to avoid when you see a product being offered on TikTok.

 First, don't go to another site. I don't remember when I got linked to a third-party site, but I did. Make sure you are completing the purchase in the TikTik Shop, because it offers protection if you don't get the item as promised.

 Second, be wary of new accounts. While some brands create a new TikTok account and start to sell legitimate merchandise, other times, a new account deserves some suspicion. If you see a brand new unverified account that is selling its own merchandise, you may want to wait to purchase. Likewise, accounts with little to no engagement may be spam accounts worthy of caution.

 Lastly, avoid products with little description. Don't buy anything with little to no product specs or descriptions. Legit sellers will outline what you're getting and how you can return it. Look for contact info, too.

##  Best Practices for TikTok Shopping

 Let's talk about the best and safest way to make a TikTok purchase. First, when you see an item you like, it's worth going to the TikTok shop and searching for the name of the product to see who else is selling it. You may find it at a more affordable price or from a more reputable seller.

 Next, make sure you're not being asked to leave the app. Always complete the purchase with a link you got on TikTok. It's also safe to use a credit card instead of a debit card. Credit cards often make it easier to dispute charges.

 Finally, ask for a refund right away if you need one using the TikTok Shop. You will likely have 30 days or less to act. I waited too long to notice that I had never received my jumpsuit, and, well, here I am. Learn from my mistakes!
