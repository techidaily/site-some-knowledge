## Shortcomings of Popcorn Time (Android/iOS) App That You May Unaware of 

The torrent-streaming platform Popcorn Time has received a strong word-of-mouth buzz as it not only helps to watch the latest movies from torrent sources without paying anything that Netflix cannot do but also leaves us deep impression for its spot-on subtitles and flawless quality of the video streaming. However, you may sometimes need a Popcorn Time replacement as it is still far from perfect in the following [Popcorn Time not working problem](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), like loading error, black screen, not downloading movies, etc. 

**1\. Bandwidth Issues:** Since Popcorn Time is still in beta, it is far from stable and easily subjected to errors, most commonly reported are: 10 to 15mins delay in video streaming, the lack of support for advanced audio codecs and jittery video playback caused by server and bandwidth issues. 

**2\. CPU Problem:** Some users reported that the CPUs worked overtime while playing movies, shows and movies ascending or descending are unavailable to sort according to Softpedia. So you are suggested to download movies for offline watching instead of taking up your CPU a lot by using a Popcorn time alternative.

**3\. No Popcorn Time for iPad iPhone:** Popcorn Time is now available for Android users, but Time4Popcorn seems to fail to cater to iOS users' movie watching needs right now, though some rumors suggest it will soon release a Popcorn Time iPhone/iPad app. So Apple users will need to seek for an alternative [Popcorn Time running on iPad](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) or iPhone, especially the newly released iPad Pro and iPhone X.

**4\. Copyright Issue:** While the torrent-streaming platform Popcorn Time already has the movie industry quaking in its proverbial boots, it also brings the filmmaking copyright issue to the top of the headlines, especially when the law enforcement officials have been emphasizing on it right now. Even though the service came back again, it also indicates the end is nigh and the copyright police is on the trail again. Accordingly, to download an alternative app to Popcorn Time without defying legality is must-have.
