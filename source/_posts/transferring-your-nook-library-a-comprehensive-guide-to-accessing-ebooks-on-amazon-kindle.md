FYI - "Part 2 - Read Nook books on Kindle does not apply to the new Fire tablets. 

 This option/choice is not available on the new (Kindle5) tablets: 

 Step 1: Hit the setting icon on the top right corner of your kindle fire. Choose" More ..."- "Device"- "Allow installation of applications" and tag "on".

 Is there any way to hack the new Kindle Fire 7 to be able to download/read Nook books? Silly Amazon is accomplishing nothing by applying this restriction, since many people have ALREADY purchased Nook ebooks that now cannot be read on anything but a cell phone!
