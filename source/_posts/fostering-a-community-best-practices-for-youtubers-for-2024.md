### Asking for subscribers

You can increase your YouTube subscribers by asking people to subscribe to your channel if they like your video. To do this, include a call to action in your video. Your call to action should be compelling to convince people to subscriber. Don’t be shy to ask your family, friends, friends of your friends to subscribe and share your video to their social accounts to more people will see and watch your video. From there you will gain more subscriber and more viewers. Also don’t forget to thank them for their effort promoting your channel.

### Promote your YouTube Channel on other platform

Promote your channel and videos on other social media like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Ask people to watch your videos and subscribe to stay updated on the new videos that you will be published.

If you want the views and the traffic, you need to be posting and updating your content consistently for best results. Upload new videos and share with your list and sphere of influence as frequently as possible.

**Provide value**

If your video fails to provide any real value to the end user, don’t be surprised when it doesn’t get any real views. Each video needs to deliver your best content, your best kept secret and your most effective strategies.

**Be remarkable**
