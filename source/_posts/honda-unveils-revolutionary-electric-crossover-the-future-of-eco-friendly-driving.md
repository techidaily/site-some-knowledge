## Honda Unveils Revolutionary Electric Crossover: The Future of Eco-Friendly Driving

The move towards electric vehicles is not a matter of if, but rather, when. It's the direction basically all car makers are moving towards, and as they keep maturing and getting better, they will likely eventually take over from regular cars. We're still a long way from that point, mind you, but it's something that's slowly happening. Honda is making a lot of moves as far as EVs go, and now, it's launching its very first mass-market EV, the Prologue.

 Honda has just launched its inaugural all-electric SUV, the 2024 Honda Prologue. Honda says that the car, which just so happens to be co-developed with GM, has an estimated range of 300 miles on a single charge and support for fast charging technology, so it should last a long time (and distance) between charges. Designed with what's described as a "neo-rugged" aesthetic, it integrates into Honda's existing SUV lineup as the first, and so far only, electric option.

 The vehicle boasts a digital instrument display and an 11.3-inch touchscreen with support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. In addition, Honda is packing the car with driver-assist technologies such as Rear Cross Traffic Braking and Blind Zone Steering Assist, providing peace of mind on the road.

 In terms of performance, the Prologue offers both front-wheel and all-wheel-drive configurations, catering to varied driving preferences. The SUV's Sport mode enhances the driving experience, emphasizing responsiveness and agility. This car doesn't come [with the new NACS port](https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-9-best-free-android-monitoring-apps-to-monitor-phone-remotely-for-your-honor-90-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/) just yet â€” Honda committed to supporting the standard, which is basically a standardized version of Tesla's charging port, by 2025\. This car will be out next year, which is a bit too soon for the hardware upgrades required for the port transition. However, we might see that in the following year's model... which makes this first model a bit less exciting.

 The car will be available from next year, so keep an eye out over the coming months if you want to get one. We don't have precise pricing, but it's expected to start at over $40,000, so you better be ready to cough up some dough.
