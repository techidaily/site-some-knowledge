### 1\. Determine the theme of the video's content

First of All, you should need to determine the theme of your vlog video. It is one of the primary steps toward a successful vlog. You should have a great idea and unique theme to attract audience. Moreover, the theme of your video should be interesting.

### 2\. Determine the basic script

To write a basic script, you must understand the script's demand and the medium of the screenplay. The procedure of writing different stories is all about writing the movement, actions, and various types of expressions with and without dialogues and, above all character of that screenplay. The basic script is the words of a video to deliver the message to the public.

(Every small scene)

| Shooting scenes | Lens serial number | Scene content                      | Field of view | Lines                      | Duration | Sound | Others                     |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | -------- | ----- | -------------------------- |
| Kitchen         | 1                  | Make breakfast,grind coffee beans… | Whole scene   | I'll make a cup of coffee… | 2 min    | bgm 1 | Pay attention to reception |

### 3\. Write your lines

Depending on the type of vlog, the lines are very important while writing a vlog scrip. For example, an educational vlogger should write his script like:

First, he must introduce himself and mention his qualification and experience in the education line. A tutorial vlog must contain some instructions to define technical points and to make the vlog more attractive for the viewers, highlight the main points so that the viewer must watch the video till the end to understand the central theme of the topic.

### 4\. Refine your script (Transition, express the frame you want to shoot in as much detail as possible)

It's time to polish your written script at this point. Transitions and the specific images you want to capture, such as the ones with the most impact, must be taken into consideration. Additionally, it would be excellent if you were aware that your script needs to be engaging from beginning to end. It also follows to your idea, has a suitable theme, and is suited for the target audience.

## Part 2\. Tips for writing an engaging vlog script

### 1\. Choose a narrative style

The best tip while writing a vlog script is using a narrative style. The narrative style makes your script more exciting and attractive for the viewers.

Choosing a narrative also determines the key to your vlog's content. Is it about your daily life? Or an important event?

### 2\. Define your personal style

In the era of making videos for all, the unique personal characteristics are the best bottom card. In simple words, you should define your own style while writing a vlog script without copying others. As the unique vlogs are best set to become popular.

### 3\. Attractive title

This is another critical feature of success. The title is the most prominent thing you should need to think about. A large number of vlogs with only attractive titles have become successful.

### 4\. Creative Intro and Outro or Video Effects and Filters

It would help if you wrote an intro that makes your audience stick to the end of the video. Your intro should be interesting, probably defining what you will do in this vlog. On the other hand, you should also need a concise outro. Moreover, using video effects and filters rather than just a simple video draws the audience's attention.
