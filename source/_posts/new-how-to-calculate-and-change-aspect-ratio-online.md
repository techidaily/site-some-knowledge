## Part 1 What is aspect ratio

Aspect ratio is a term that simply describes the proportional relationship of width with the height of your photo. It checks how wide the image is. It is not the image resolution; infact, it is the ratio of width to height.

For instance, Movies at the theatre have a 16:9 aspect ratio. It has no relation to the image's quality or size. It just states that the width of a picture is almost twice the length.

Most TV or computer screens have a 1.33:1 aspect. It means they are generally much closer to square as compared to big cinema screens. Therefore, modern TV sets have an option of widescreen.

In this way, you can watch the movies closer to the original format, and there will be no cutting of the shots. The aspect ratio is a term that was first related to shapes and geometry, later adapter to still and moving images.

You represent the aspect ratio for different shapes by x:y, but actual figures do not matter till the ratio is same. For instance, the aspect ratio of a rectangle is the ratio of its long side to the short side.

## Part 1 What is aspect ratio

Aspect ratio is a term that simply describes the proportional relationship of width with the height of your photo. It checks how wide the image is. It is not the image resolution; infact, it is the ratio of width to height.

For instance, Movies at the theatre have a 16:9 aspect ratio. It has no relation to the image's quality or size. It just states that the width of a picture is almost twice the length.

Most TV or computer screens have a 1.33:1 aspect. It means they are generally much closer to square as compared to big cinema screens. Therefore, modern TV sets have an option of widescreen.

In this way, you can watch the movies closer to the original format, and there will be no cutting of the shots. The aspect ratio is a term that was first related to shapes and geometry, later adapter to still and moving images.

You represent the aspect ratio for different shapes by x:y, but actual figures do not matter till the ratio is same. For instance, the aspect ratio of a rectangle is the ratio of its long side to the short side.
