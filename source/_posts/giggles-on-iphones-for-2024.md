## Giggles on iPhones

We all know that GIFs are an exciting way to communicate with friends and families and are very popular among teenagers. There are so many ways to search memes for iPhone; let's look at the inbuilt options that Apple has given along with some of the most used third-party applications. Memes for iPhone come with extra clarity and more fun.

## How to find the iMessage GIF keyboard?

If you are using ios10 or more, you have a GIF keyboard attached to the messaging app with the name of #images. If you don't have one, you can also use a few 3rd party applications.

* Click on the messages and start composing a new one or continue with the existing message.

* If the #images icon is not visible, press the icon with four bubbles on the bottom left corner.

## 1\. Mematic

Mematic is nothing but a meme generator app that allows clients to create new and exciting memes. Memes made through this app show a watermark at the left bottom corner that says 'made with Mematic.' In 2012, iOS brought this app into use. After three years of service, this app was later updated so that android users could use it as well. This app is similar to other meme applications that provide different GIFs and images.

In the beginning, the users need to select a style of image macro that includes a demotivational poster, tweets, top and bottom text, breaking news, and many more. Users can either choose a photo of the folder given by the app, or they can also add it from the phone's camera roll. They can also text and can reposition it.
