## Unable to Transfer/Play MP4 on iPad? Convert MP4 to iPad Codecs

 iPad only supports .mp4 file format encoded by **H264, MPEG-4 or Motion JPEG (M-JPEG)**. As for the .mp4 file encoded by other codecs like AVC, MPEG-2, your iPad doesn't accept them and that's why MP4 can't transfer to iPad. 

On top of MP4 codecs, another point you need to pay attention to is that iPad also has its standard limits on .mp4 video **parameter** settings. If your .mp4 (H264) file features 60 frames per second, there stands a big chance that you fail to play MP4 video on iPad normally due to the non-standard parameters. In addition, suppose that you open Safari to play online MP4 but this HTML5 video isn't playing on iPad, no need to look around, **HTML5 player** is the chief culprit.

To cure the above MP4 iPad problems, you need an all-round solution, which can give you enough power to convert MP4 to iPad supported codecs, parameters and also free download online MP4 video movies to iPad to solve HTML5 player trouble. And this kind of solution you're looking for is:
