**MPEG**, standing for Moving Picture Experts Group, is the name of a family of standards used for coding audio-visual information (e.g., movies, video, music) in a digital compressed format. The common-used standards are MPEG-1(.MPG), MPEG-2(.MPG) and MPEG-4(.MP4).

The major advantage of MPEG compared to other video and audio coding formats is that MPEG files are much smaller at the same level of video quality. Attracted by this feature, more people are willing to rip DVD to MPEG for backup. To do the task, a [DVD to MPEG converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is highly demanded.
