)

#### 1\.  Design Accessories

 If we talk about looks then GoPro Hero4 can be rated as one of the most awesome device and its waterproof housing make it more suitable for adventure sports activities. It comes with so many accessories that help in easy and efficient recording. You can see WiFi and camera recording status on two small slits that are attached to front portion of this camera near the LED screen. On right side of this screen you will find a settings button that also allows users to make settings for Wi-Fi connectivity. The latest design of Hero4 Black makes battery swiping feature much easier and allows users to record videos for longer duration.


![gopro hero black 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-hero-black-4.jpg)

 One of the most interesting features of Hero4 Black is its 4K video resolution ability that can be generated at maximum frame rate of 30fps. You can edit the videos generated by GoPro Hero4 black device and customized results can be obtained. Some of the additional but impressive features of this GoPro device are video mode selection facility, image sharpness, color contrast and low light performance. In case if you want to record videos at 1080p then it is possible to get maximum frame rate of 120fps whereas slow motion recording can also be enabled. For 720p recording you will be glad to access the maximum frame rate of 240fps. Most of users love to enjoy time lapse stitching with GoPro Hero4 Black device.

 On the other side, if we talk about GoPro Hero4 Black picture quality then its f/2.8 lens can offer 170 degree wide point of view so that every specific detail can be captured so clearly. It is possible to make selections between 5MP, 7Mp and 12MP modes for stills whereas some users will love to take advantage from night mode and burst mode.

 This device is capable enough to replace most of costly DSLR devices in market and is one step ahead of highest quality mobile phones. You will be able to take benefits from its color modes, exposure tuning, white balance and ISO selectivity. Only drawback of Hero4 Black is its small battery life that can assist you only for one hour when you have enabled Wi-Fi feature.

#### 2\.  Connectivity

 While talking about all awesome features of GoPro Hero4 Black, how can be forgot to include its connectivity. This device is enabled with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity facility and users can control almost all features from mobile devices using GoPro application. With this advanced software application you can easily preview or playback your recording and once finalized then it can be easily shared on social media websites like Instagram, Facebook as well as via email. If you make use of Bluetooth feature instead of Wi-Fi then its battery can serve you little longer. The smart recording feature allows users to control almost 50 cameras simultaneously at the maximum distance of 600’ line of sight. In the whole GoPro series, GoPro Hero4 Black was the first device that possesses Wi-Fi along with Bluetooth connectivity.

#### 3\.  Battery life and Storage capacity

 This device comes with a 1160mAh battery that can serve you for 1 hour 30 minutes if you are recording at 1080p resolution where frame rate is 30fps, but note that Wi-Fi is disabled. In case if you are using Wi-Fi as well as Smart Phone application then this recording time will naturally fall by 15 minutes. If you want to use this device for full day shooting then i8t is good to go for Wi-Fi disabled mode and bring multiple batteries with you on tour.

 If we talk about the storage offered by GoPro Hero5 black then the bad news is that it does not offer any internal storage but the great feature is that external MicroSD card storage can be extended up to 64 GB. If you are recording in UHD mode at 30fps then it can record maxi8mum up to 2 hours and 20 minutes whereas in case of 1080p at 30 fps you can enjoy long hour recording up to 4 hours 40 minutes.

#### 4\.  Live Streaming

 The coolest option available with GoPro Hero4 Black is its ability to serve for live streaming needs. It is much easier to transfer videos from Camera to smartphone as well as tablet using Wi-Fi connectivity but you need to run Meerkat or LiveStream application on your portable device to make this connection. It will help users to deliver content directly to websites. LiveStream application works perfectly on iOS devices but the videos go to live streamed channel with a delay of 10 seconds at max.

 If you love to share your content online then Hero4 Black could be one of the most superior devices for you. Your breathtaking videos will be definitely joyful for viewers and they will be able to take the crystal clear idea of your adventurous trip.

## The Bottom line

 Although the video as well as image quality of this device is almost same in case of Hero5 black device but for that you need to pay little higher amount. The cost varies by almost $70 in case of GoPro Hero5 Black, but it has additional features like Digital Image Stabilization, microphone connectivity wi9th much better clarity and wind noise reduction ability. When compared with other competitors, Hero5 Black is proven to be best device for all action camera lovers and it can serve with all amazing features at reasonable price range.

)

 One of the most interesting features of Hero4 Black is its 4K video resolution ability that can be generated at maximum frame rate of 30fps. You can edit the videos generated by GoPro Hero4 black device and customized results can be obtained. Some of the additional but impressive features of this GoPro device are video mode selection facility, image sharpness, color contrast and low light performance. In case if you want to record videos at 1080p then it is possible to get maximum frame rate of 120fps whereas slow motion recording can also be enabled. For 720p recording you will be glad to access the maximum frame rate of 240fps. Most of users love to enjoy time lapse stitching with GoPro Hero4 Black device.

 On the other side, if we talk about GoPro Hero4 Black picture quality then its f/2.8 lens can offer 170 degree wide point of view so that every specific detail can be captured so clearly. It is possible to make selections between 5MP, 7Mp and 12MP modes for stills whereas some users will love to take advantage from night mode and burst mode.

 This device is capable enough to replace most of costly DSLR devices in market and is one step ahead of highest quality mobile phones. You will be able to take benefits from its color modes, exposure tuning, white balance and ISO selectivity. Only drawback of Hero4 Black is its small battery life that can assist you only for one hour when you have enabled Wi-Fi feature.

#### 2\.  Connectivity

 While talking about all awesome features of GoPro Hero4 Black, how can be forgot to include its connectivity. This device is enabled with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity facility and users can control almost all features from mobile devices using GoPro application. With this advanced software application you can easily preview or playback your recording and once finalized then it can be easily shared on social media websites like Instagram, Facebook as well as via email. If you make use of Bluetooth feature instead of Wi-Fi then its battery can serve you little longer. The smart recording feature allows users to control almost 50 cameras simultaneously at the maximum distance of 600’ line of sight. In the whole GoPro series, GoPro Hero4 Black was the first device that possesses Wi-Fi along with Bluetooth connectivity.

#### 3\.  Battery life and Storage capacity

 This device comes with a 1160mAh battery that can serve you for 1 hour 30 minutes if you are recording at 1080p resolution where frame rate is 30fps, but note that Wi-Fi is disabled. In case if you are using Wi-Fi as well as Smart Phone application then this recording time will naturally fall by 15 minutes. If you want to use this device for full day shooting then i8t is good to go for Wi-Fi disabled mode and bring multiple batteries with you on tour.

 If we talk about the storage offered by GoPro Hero5 black then the bad news is that it does not offer any internal storage but the great feature is that external MicroSD card storage can be extended up to 64 GB. If you are recording in UHD mode at 30fps then it can record maxi8mum up to 2 hours and 20 minutes whereas in case of 1080p at 30 fps you can enjoy long hour recording up to 4 hours 40 minutes.

#### 4\.  Live Streaming

 The coolest option available with GoPro Hero4 Black is its ability to serve for live streaming needs. It is much easier to transfer videos from Camera to smartphone as well as tablet using Wi-Fi connectivity but you need to run Meerkat or LiveStream application on your portable device to make this connection. It will help users to deliver content directly to websites. LiveStream application works perfectly on iOS devices but the videos go to live streamed channel with a delay of 10 seconds at max.

 If you love to share your content online then Hero4 Black could be one of the most superior devices for you. Your breathtaking videos will be definitely joyful for viewers and they will be able to take the crystal clear idea of your adventurous trip.

## The Bottom line

 Although the video as well as image quality of this device is almost same in case of Hero5 black device but for that you need to pay little higher amount. The cost varies by almost $70 in case of GoPro Hero5 Black, but it has additional features like Digital Image Stabilization, microphone connectivity wi9th much better clarity and wind noise reduction ability. When compared with other competitors, Hero5 Black is proven to be best device for all action camera lovers and it can serve with all amazing features at reasonable price range.
