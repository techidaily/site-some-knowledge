## How do I Rip DVD to Plex within Clicks 

MacX is incredibly easy to use, but even expert users can benefit from reading a few tips and tricks. Let's take a look at a quick overview of everything that this DVD to Plex ripper software can do.

**Step 1.** Free download the DVD to Plex ripper and open it. Insert the DVD you'd like to rip to Plex into your Mac (or PC).

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-ripper-pro/../seoimage/download-icon-step.png)[Free download DVD to plex ripper on windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) 

**Step 2\.** Tap "DVD disc", "ISO image" or "DVD Folder" to load the DVD source into the ripper. After the DVD importing is successfully finished, the DVD title will be auto detected and ticked by this utility. The DVD info including DVD movie length, resolution, aspect ratio, audio channel and subtitle will show up at the home screen, as well.

**Step 3\.** To convert DVD to Plex media server, select "MP4 H264" as output format from the "General Profiles" category at the pop-up window. You can also freely move the slide bar to adjust LQ (low quality) to HQ (high quality) or vice versa. Of course, higher quality comes at the cost of slower speed.

![rip DVD to plex mp4](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-ripper-pro/../mac-video-converter-pro/img-speed/22.png) 

**Step 4\.**  Go back to main interface and hit the settings icon next to the output format icon. Here you can adjust the DVD to Plex ripping settings like audio codec, movie resolution, frame rate, aspect ratio, video codec, etc. 

If needed, also click the "Edit" icon with a scissor-shaped icon to cut off the unnecessary opening/ending, add external subtitles to movie, cropp video, merge TV episodes into one, etc.

Moreover, if your computer hardware supports GPU hardware accelerator, this top DVD to Plex ripping software will auto detect that and activate its built-in GPU hardware accelerator to speed up DVD to MP4 converting, as well. Both hardware decoding and encoding are accessible. It can rip a full DVD to MP4 H264 within 5 mins (certainly your computer configurations should be strong enough, too).

After a few minutes, the rip will finish and you can add the ripped DVD video into Plex media server. 

_**Warm Prompt:** The software developer calls for copying or ripping DVD under the concept of Fair Use and does not encourage any illegal reproduction or distribution of copyrighted content. Please abide by the local DVD copyright law before doing it._
