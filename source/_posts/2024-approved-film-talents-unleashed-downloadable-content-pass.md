## Part 1: The definition of a talent release form

 Now, you may wonder, what exactly is a talent release form?

 And what‚Äôs the purpose of it, right? Basically, a talent release form is a legal document that authorizes the filmmaker to sell or distribute the film/video after production that features your talent.

 In other words, this legal document is specifically formulated and must be signed by the talent featured in the film/video to protect you from getting sued.

 For instance, let‚Äôs suppose, once the production has wrapped up and you‚Äôre all set to get the film/video out for promotion or for any commercial purpose or release it digitally.

 Your talent, out of the blue, goes cold feet and puts up a case on you for unauthorized utilization of someone's image or voice.

 This is where a talent release form (also termed as film release forms or video release forms) safeguards you from any such legal issues.

## Part 2: When to sign up a talent release form

 Now, you‚Äôre well-versed with what a talent release form or an actor release form is and the purpose for it.

 Therefore, in this section we‚Äôll discuss about when to get a talent release form signed up.

 Basically, you need to get a talent release form signed before the film/video production starts. You‚Äôll need it whenever you plan to sell the film/video, or the rights to the production.

 This is because the interested media company will require these talent releases before finalizing the deal.

 You must ensure to obtain a talent release form from both primary actors and extras involved in that particular video production.
