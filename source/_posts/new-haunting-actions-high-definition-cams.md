#### **Video and Photo Quality:**

 Video and photo quality of Drift Ghost S is good enough as compared to other competing devices in the same price range. You can easily set recording to different modes for capturing footage with customized resolution level and frame rates. The wide angle focus create much better views for adventure sports lovers that is why this camera is often purchased by travellers.

If you start recording at 960p then frame rate can be adjusted to 48fps whereas if you need to slow down videos then it is good to switch to 720p. With 960p and 720p the FOV limits to 160 degrees. The video compression level can be also adjusted with ease by choosing high bit rates or normal mode.

 It is possible to record footage with Ghost S in high bit rate as well as in normal mode. The still quality is 12MP that offers crystal clear views. When you use normal bit rate at 1080p then edges of videos appear jagged and interlaced. But this issue can be slightly resolved with high bit rate settings. If you want to switch to time lapse mode then it is possible to adjust shoot timings to 10, 5, 3, 2, 1 and 0.5 second intervals. With burst mode setting, you can easily capture 5 or 10 impressive shots within each second.

It is also possible to enjoy live view of shoots via smart phone applications but it may lead to little lag. You would love to copy all captured videos and photographs to your smart phone via these camera applications.

#### **Battery Life and Storage:**

 This camera consists of a Micro SDXC type card slot that can easily support cards up to 64 GB capacities. Other than this, your camera possesses Mini-HDMI ports, Mini-USB ports and a large size battery that can support long hour recording. With this big size battery you can easily record up to 3.5 hours with 1080p settings at 30fps frame rate. And if you go ahead with reduced resolution levels then it is possible to record for much longer duration.

#### **The Bottom Line:**

 There is no doubt to say that Drift Ghost S device comes with large screen and intuitive control options. You can also preview you footage before uploading it on any social media platform. Although this device is much costlier as compared to Ghost HD but at the same time possesses all incredible features as like impressive video recording modes.
