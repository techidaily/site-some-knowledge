## Design and Features

#### 1.Design Style

 Considering the design of BenQ BL2711U we must say that this monitor is designed to serve users in mild environments like design studios or offices. Manufacturers have not added much bling to this design rather they focused more on minimalistic design that can suit to professional atmosphere. The cabinet was finished with attractive matte black exterior where the grippy, subtle and finger print free texture make it more appealing. The bezels have same appearance as that of the cabinet so you will not observe any distraction for viewing experience on this 27” screen. BenQ BL2711U is finished with a medium range anti glare coating so you can have a reflection free view but it introduces little grainy texture to this monitor. Note that the stand attached to this BL series appears almost same as that of old XL series. Users can rotate, swivel, tilt and rise this display as per their own needs.

#### 2. Ports and Connectivity

 All the connections are placed on rear portion of the cabinet and they are facing downward. Such kind of orientation assist in better cable management as one can easily take them out from the neck hole on the mount. The connectivity options for input include HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.2 that works on 60Hz rating for delivering 4K content. In case of HDMI 1.4 port and the DVI port, you will be able to operate monitor for 30Hz range whereas separate USB ports are added for downstream and upstream needs. This panel also consists of a dedicated switch for On/Off operations that makes this monitor handy. One missing connectivity option is USB-C thunderbolt 3 port that could otherwise may this monitor able to handle various features of Apple.
