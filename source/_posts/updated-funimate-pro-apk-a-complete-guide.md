## 3\. How to Use Funimate Pro

Funimate allows users to follow people on the site, so they are always in touch with strangers. Parents should check their child's buddy list regularly to monitor activities. Overall, Funimate is a fun tool for kids to experiment with video editing and be creative, but parents should keep an eye on their child's privacy settings and interactions while using the app. The editor itself is pretty straightforward to use. To use the editor like an expert, though, you may watch lessons in the upper left corner of the screen or take a cue from the sample video in your document.

### Steps to Use Funimate Pro

_Step 1:_ Simply choose any movie from the app that you wish to utilize, and then select the needed photographs by granting the app access to your gallery. That's all there is to it. You now have a terrific template that will show off your picture video tale in seconds.
