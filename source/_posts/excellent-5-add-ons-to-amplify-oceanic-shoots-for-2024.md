 Are you depressed about the poor photo quality and recorded video underwater? Often the photographers are under dilemma despite trying their best efforts to shoot high quality videos [underwater](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## How to Choose the Right Filter for GoPro Underwater Shooting

 If you have not heard of the GoPro filters before, it is important to consider that you will find different types of filters when buying. Choosing the right one depending on your requirements plays the key role in determining your video capturing success.

 Different Types of Camera Filters and their Uses:

**1\. Red Filte:** Works great for shooting in blue water.

 Best Usage: Under natural, surround light in blue water. (no video flash lights)

**2\. Magenta Filter:** Necessary for shooting in green water

 Best Usage: Under natural, surround light in green water. (no video flash lights)

**3\. Macro Filter:** Very essential for capturing small underwater subjects

 Best Usage 1: Using macro with red filter is great idea so that you can shoot under natural light. (You do not need the video flashlights as the red filter produces the red color effect). You can also use the macro filter only. You can also use the red filter only avoiding the macro lens.  
Also, check Switchblade- excellent among the GoPro filters for flexible adjustments for everything you need.

 Best Usage 2: Use the macro filter alone with the video lights to achieve clear view of the minute details (maintain medium light availability to control the brightness effect)

 Best Usage 3: Simply use the macro filter alone for topside clear view of small objects

**4\. Switchblade 2.0 Filter:** Gives you the facility to use macro and red filter together. You can also flip between red filter for shooting at wide-angle and the macro lens for capturing small subjects.

 Best Usage 1: Use it without using the video lights to capture macro subjects

 Best Usage 2: Disable the ‘fisheye effect’. Capture from a close angle to fill the entire frame with the main subject to show more detailed, refine and astonishing footage.

**5\. Polarizing Filter:** Use it for shooting topside photos and videos and control reflected sunlight

 Best Usage: Shoot photos and videos topside in natural bright sunlight

**6\. Neutral Density Filter:**  Useful for taking topside videos to minimize the shutter speed

 Best Usage 1: Take photos and videos of static subjects or the subjects requiring the blur effect to show continued time passage and speed effect
Best Usage 2: Capture prominent GoPro time lapse videos or get the best results when the camera mount is set on vibrating surface
