## Part 1\. Why Do You Need 8K Video Converter?

Currently, 8K videos are not widely supported by displays, devices, and software. Besides, 8K videos are very large in size that it is quite difficult to upload, share and stream across the network. 

![8K Video Issues](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/8k-converter.jpg) 

**8K video is not widely supported by devices/displays:** At present, the majority of 8K 4320p videos are formatted by H.265/HEVC, which is mainly designed for next-gen HDTV, satellite TV. So if you play 8K videos on your computer with common video player, you actually can't enjoy the 8K video at full resolution of 7680x4320 pixels, cuz the screen resolution of your computer doesn't reach 8K Full Ultra HD. The same situation happens to your mobile device. The current mobile device supports you to play video up to 4K in H264\. If you import 8K H.265 video to iPhone iPad, what you get is only a message: "XXX. h265.mp4" was not copied to iPad because it cannot be played on this iPad.

**8K video playback is often choppy:** Even you have a forced 8K video playback with your media player, often the case you will get choppy video playback as y our hardware is not that powerful to handle the heavy 8K video during the whole process.

**8K video is too large to upload, share & stream:** Higher quality means larger size. The same video file in 8K 4320p resolution is of course larger than that in 4K 2160p. So if you spend 10 minutes to upload a 4K video to YouTube, then you will spend at least 25 minutes on 8K video to YouTube uploading. To share 8K video to friends via E-mail or online transferring is the same bandwidth-hog and time-consuming task.

So, a [video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) that can convert and compress 8K videos is what you are looking for.
