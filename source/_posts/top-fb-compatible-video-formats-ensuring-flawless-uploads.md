## Best Video/Audio Codec Settings for Facebook Uploading

To be frank, the video format is just the one of the factors impacting on the Facebook uploading. Knowing the best video format that Facebook supports is just the first step for a smooth video uploading to Facebook. There are other settings like codec, resolution, aspect ratio, bitrate, frame rate, etc you will need to know before you go the video upload process. The following best Facebook video and audio settings are listed if you want to go into deep study about the best video format for Facebook. 

**1\. Best Facebook Video Upload Format and Settings**

| **Codec**        | The best format to upload to Facebook is **H.264 video with AAC audio in MP4 or MOV** format. It currently gives you a great bang for your buck in the file size to relative quality ratio, offering the best video compression available, and due to the [file size limitations in Facebook](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), this format is the optimal choice for Facebook video. And there's no need to change the parameter during Facebook uploading. |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Resolution**   | Use a file with the larger edge of the video constrained to **1280px**. If your video is less than 1280px in size on the larger edge, try to keep your dimensions to multiples of 16px for best compression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Frame rate**   | Usually videos have the best quality if the frame rate is between 25-30 fps. So you are recommended to keep the frame rate of your video at or below **30fps**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Aspect Ratio** | The aspect ratio of the video must be within the range of **9x16 to 16x9** which most videos should have, and the video exceeding the file size or length that the upload page suggests will be rejected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Bitrate**      | There is no recommendation for Bitrate as it highly rests upon codec. So you are suggested to optimize video for resolution, aspect ratio and frame rate rather than bitrate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

**2\. Best Facebook Audio File Format and Settings**

| **Codec**         | MP3 is preferred                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sampling rate** | Use stereo audio with a sample rate of **44,100hz**.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Channels**      | The number of audio channels will be maintained for stereo and mono streams. 5.1-channel audio will be down-mixed to stereo. All other channel configurations are currently unsupported. |
