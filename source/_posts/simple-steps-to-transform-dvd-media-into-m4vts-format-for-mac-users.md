_"My concern is that I would like to convert some of my DVD collections to TS videos and stream them to my TS-playable gadget so as to watch the DVD movies when I'm on the road. However, I always received an error code each time I tried to convert DVD to TS. Is there any solution? Thanks in advance." --Debra_

**TS**, the abbreviation of Transport Stream (TS, M2TS and MTS in high definition), is a standard format for transmission and storage of audio, video and data, specified in MPEG-2 Part 1\. Its design goal is to multiplex digital video and audio as well as to synchronize the output. Transport stream specifies a container format encapsulating packetized streams, with error correction and stream synchronization features for maintaining transmission integrity when the signal is degraded. Because of that, TS video is widely used in broadcast systems such as DVB and ATSC and often used on high-end video players, offering users fluent entertainment experience.
