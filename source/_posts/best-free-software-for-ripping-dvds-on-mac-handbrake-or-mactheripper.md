## Rip DVD on Mac for Free with MacTheRipper 

[**MacTheRipper**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) (as known as MTR) is a free DVD ripper (extractor) working under macOS. Same to Handbrake, MTR has received wide recognition for its powerful abilities to rip a DVD. To be specific, it offers 4 modes to help extract content from a DVD: ISO image, Rip & Rebuild (RnR), Batch extraction, and Main feature. Currently, there are three versions available: MTR 4.1, MTR 300, and MTR 2.6.6\. Only MTR 2.6.6 is free but it only works on Mac OS X 10.6 Leopard and older. 

![Is MacTheRipper better than Handbrake](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/mac-the-ripper-083001.jpg) 

MacTheRipper

**Pros:**

* Mac The Ripper has a stand-alone DVDProbe application to help disable CSS encryption and Macrovision protection, [remove region code](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) by setting the disc's region to '0' for region-free and get rid of RCE region checking. Better still, it allows you to copy DVDs on Mac in VIDEO\_TS folder, regardless of ARccOS copy protection.
* Unlike the complicated Handbrake, MacTheRipper has a very clear manual and an intuitive interface, which makes it more acceptable by non-professionals.
* MacTheRipper can rip DVD to VOB without quality loss. It contains the full menus, and extra features.
* MacTheRipper endeavors to rip the main feature of a 100-min DVD movie in 22 minutes and 52 seconds, which is really a shorter period of time compared with other similar DVD rippers for Mac.

**Cons:**

* MTR 2.6.6 does not work on macOS later than Snow Leopard. Even the latest MacTheRipper 4.1 only works on Mac OS X 10.7 or older OS. Compared to MactheRipper, Handbrake has a better compatibility with the latest macOS.
* MacTheRipper 3.0 and MacTheRipper 4.1 is not free. And you have to send a gift which can cost up to $40 and finish the complex process to get the registration code.
* Mac The Ripper can only copy DVD to hard drive in VIDEO\_TS folder, which is not supported by most portable devices. And the extract media can be large in size. If you want to watch DVDs on your iPhone, iPad, Android, Handbrake is better than Mac The Ripper.
* MacTheRipper only supports part of the Macrovision and CSS protections. Note that MacTheRipper 4 doesn't support commercial DVD movies. Same to Handbrake, MacTheRipper won't deal with other protections like ARccOS, AACS, CPRM, Disney, etc.

##  Free Rip DVD Movie on Mac with Handbrake 

[**Handbrake**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), similar to MacTheRipper, has a long history and still dominates the DVD ripper market whether you are using Mac, Linux, or Windows. This free DVD ripper allows Mac users to liberate movie content from the stiff disc and make it viewable on iPhone iPad without striking a blow. One of the big reasons that people love it is: it's free and open-source, and it gets the job done easily. 

![Handbrake vs Mactheripper review](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/handbrake-interface.png) 

Handbrake

**Pros:**

* Handbrake provides handy presets for Apple devices, etc, making it pretty easier. So if you want to rip DVD for playing on iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple TV, this free DVD ripper for Mac can be your first choice.
* Compared with Mac The Ripper, Handbrake supports more output formats. It rips DVD to MP4, MKV, and WebM formats with smaller size while MacTheRipper only helps to save DVD in VIDEO\_TS folder.
* Handbrake supports GPU acceleration techs to speed up the whole DVD ripping. It is able to rip DVD to H.264/H.265 at a fast speed with high quality.
* There are a wide range of settings and editing features to customize the output video.

**Cons:**

* MacTheRipper is better than Handbrake in dealing the copy protection as Handbrake itself can't rip any DVDs protected by CSS, Sony ARccOS, Region protection, UOP, APS, etc. But it's able to remove CSS with the VLC libdvdcss library.
* While Handbrake is able to rip DVD to other formats, it can't keep the special features/menus. That's to say, compared to MacTheRipper, Handbrake will generate quality loss.
* While MacTheRipper is easy to use, Handbrake is not. While there are various settings and parameters in Handbrake to customize the DVD ripping, getting started with Handbrake requires a steep learning curve.
* Handbrake DVD ripping problems occur now and then, including unable to detect DVD disc, no valid source found, DVD ripping hangs, jagged edge, poor CPU utilization in Handbrake, video audio garbled, incomplete DVD rips, etc.
