So, you can use the "DVD Player" application to play DVDs or DVD movie files stored on your Mac, such as the Video\_TS folder or ISO image files. Let's go through the steps to play a DVD on MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, or Mac mini using the DVD Player App.

![note icon](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../image-style/new-seo/icon0.png)

_To enable DVD playback on your Mac, especially if it lacks a built-in disc drive, you can acquire an external DVD drive. Apple offers a USB SuperDrive priced at $79.00, which is compatible with iMac, Mac mini, MacBook Pro with Retina Display, and MacBook Air. With this device, the process is straightforward: simply insert the DVD into the SuperDrive, and the DVD Player app should automatically launch and begin playing the disc._

### Problems:

It seems simple enough to play and watch DVDs on a MacBook Pro/Ai/iMac with an optical drive. However, there are still complaints reporting that [DVDs won't play on Macs](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). So below we offer some major fixes on how to watch DVDs on MacBook Pro/Mac Pro, other computers without problems. 

**Fixes to Mac DVD Player Not Working Error:**

* Check System Preferences -> CD's & DVD's to check if the DVD player is set to run when a DVD is put into the drive.
* Reset the SMC on Mac computers.
* Check if the DVD player supports the type of disc, for example, you may need to adjust the region code for DVDs with other codes, and Mac's default player won't support Blu-ray discs.
* Switch to another DVD player for Mac. Other popular and free DVD players for Mac include VLC Media Player, 5KPlayer, MPlayer, Kodi Player, PowerDVD, etc.

![note icon](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../image-style/new-seo/icon0.png)

This method requires you to take along the movie discs and drive whenever and wherever you want to watch DVDs on MacBook Pro/Air, iMac or Mac mini computers. It is not available for copying and playing copyright protected DVD discs. The DVD Player app on Mac **cannot play DVDs from other regions after 4 changes**. It won't support other media, such as Blu-ray discs, or recognize video content recorded on certain types of DVD-RW discs.

## Method 3\. How to Play DVD on Mac with 3rd-party DVD Players for Mac

As the built-in DVD Player app on Mac can't play DVDs with copy protections, you can rely on another DVD player software for MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, or Mac mini. Here we recommend you some best Mac DVD player options:

### 5KPlayer 

5KPlayer plays any DVD movies on MacOS/Windows. It supports DVD disc, DVD-R/RW, ISO image, and Video\_TS files. You can use it to watch any region encoded DVDs and CSS-encrypted DVD movies on Mac.

## Method 4\. How to Play DVD on Mac with Remote Disc?

Remote Disc is a Mac feature that allows one Mac to share and access another Mac's DVD/CD drive as if it was their own. That is to say, you can insert a DVD into a drive on one Mac, and watch the DVD on another Mac over the network.

Also, Remote Disc allows these Macs without optical drives to achieve many other great functions, such as installing software from DVDs, importing CDs into iTunes, ripping DVDs, and even burning CDs and DVDs. However, Remote Disc doesn't allow users to play audio CDs or copy-protected DVDs on Mac. Now, let's see how to open a DVD on Mac via Remote Disc:

**Step 1:** On a Mac with the built-in SuperDrive, open "System Preferences".

**Step 2:** Click on "Sharing", then choose the lock icon.

**Step 3:** Enter your admin password, tick DVD Sharing. This feature is only available on a Mac with an optical drive. 

**Step 4:** Insert a DVD into the drive and the user on another Mac will be able to watch the DVD.

However, this way requires two Macs connected over a network. So, it may not be suitable for you if you only have one Mac. 

![Play DVD with Remote Disc](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/remote-disc.png) 

![note icon](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../image-style/new-seo/icon0.png)

This method requires **two computers running at the same time** when you watch DVD movies on MacBook Pro or Air, iMac or Mac mini. Besides, internet access is also required to share the DVD movie. So remote disc can be very slow over the network. Besides, not all types of DVDs are supported. You **can't play protected DVDs on Mac** this way.
