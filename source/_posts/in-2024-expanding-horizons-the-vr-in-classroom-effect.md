### 1\. Virtual Reality Classrooms

 Immersing the class in virtual reality is one of the best ways to instigate learning and to stimulate their interests. There have been a few pilot projects that included children having the ability to learn regular subjects with the help of virtual reality and the results have been phenomenal. Not only are students more engaged in the material that they have been working on, but they have put more effort into their assigned tasks. According to Benjamin Lloyd, a teacher at Highland Park Middle School, the students that have had the opportunity to learn using VR have even come to school early to engage in the technology and learning materials.

 Having virtual reality classrooms is just one of the many ways that VR is going to revolutionize the way children learn and their level of interest in each of their subjects. It’s perfect for adapting to different learning styles and opens the door for group involvement and peer teaching, two of the best ways for students to learn regardless of if they are hands-on or textbook learners.

### 2\. Making the Impossible and Possible

 When a child begins to emerge with interests in different fields, mechanics as an example, it’s assumed that they will never be able to get the real hands-on experience that they need to become a professional at such a young age. Though with virtual reality, teachers are able to make the impossible, possible, and give children the ability to fine tune their motor skills and work on things that they otherwise wouldn’t have access to. The extraordinarily immerse environment allows students to work on any real life applications regardless of their skill level because there aren’t any hazards involved.

 As an example, a student interested in becoming a mechanic will be able to do an oil change or change an engine using virtual reality in an augmented universe. This gives them the skills that they need without putting them in a dangerous environment.

### 3\. Game-Based Experiences

 It’s known that every student loves playing games, even adults enjoy playing games. School can become a mundane and boring environment for anyone of any age, even college students consistently complain about lectures, labs, and other parts of their education. Imagine having the ability to teach the same great curriculum but in a way that children will remember for the rest of their lives.

 Virtual reality gives teachers the ability to adapt learning to technology and improve the level of engagement that students have on a regular basis. It’s important that educators provide inspiration and encouragement for students to explore more opportunities and to learn new ways to solve problems. With the ability to turn the focus on fun education, students will be more likely to want to learn than to veer their desires to play.

### 4\. Inspiring Creative Learning

 Virtual reality is responsible for inspiring creative learning, something that has been lacking from educational facilities for years. They are responsible for creating a brand new world of imagination that not only entices the minds of people of all ages, but that also encourages them to explore more. At this moment in time, the majority of virtual reality technologies are used for pure enjoyment and extra curricular activities. It is important to remember that there is still work that needs to be done in order to curb the attention away from play and more towards learning purposes. Regardless, it’s a transformation in the way that the average student perceives school.
