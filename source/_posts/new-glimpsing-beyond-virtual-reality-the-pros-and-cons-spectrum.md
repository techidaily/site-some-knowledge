Though the virtual reality technology is used in various fields but is still experimental. It is not being accepted or fully developed. The VR has many cons due to which it is not acceptable fully.

* **Training in VR environment is not real**

Another con of virtual reality is that a person who has been trained in VR environment may do well in that environment, but he cannot perform well in the real world. Hence, it will not give the same results in real life situations as compare to Virtual Reality environment.
