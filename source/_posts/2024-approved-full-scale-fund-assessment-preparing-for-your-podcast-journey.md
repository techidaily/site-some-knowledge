## Part 1: A podcast checklist before podcasting

Podcasting is not a cost-money thing compared to starting a YouTube channel. Here is a to-do list for a successful podcast channel. We've also indicated the ones that require money and the ones that do not.

| **Checklist**                       | **Need Money or Not** |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Plan Your Podcast                   | No                    |
| Create A Podcast Brand              | No                    |
| Setup Your Equipment                | Yes                   |
| Choose Your Recording Software      | Yes                   |
| Prepare for Your Podcast Recordings | No                    |
| Record A Few First Episodes         | No                    |
| Edit Your Podcast Recordings        | No                    |
| Publish Your Podcast Show           | Yes, the hosting fee  |
| Promote & Monetize Your Podcast     | Yes, Marketing        |

Only a few things on the podcast checklist in the table above require you to spend money. But the good news is that you don't necessarily need to spend on hosting fees and marketing when you're just starting a podcast. Instead, you can stick with the basics like a microphone, computer, and recording software for a start. Then, later on, you can invest extra money for things like marketing and improved hosting.

That said, proceed to find out how much it'll cost to invest in the basic things you need to start a podcast based on different budget packages that suit your needs.

| **Headphones**                     | $50 - $150                             |
| **Total Amount**                   | $240 - $290                            |

Even if some people think headphone is not essential, you still need one for podcasting. Yes, it would help if you had it for hearing your voice while speaking into the microphone, and one of the best you can start with is the Srhythm NC25 Noise Cancelling Headphones.

The above podcasting items are highly recommended for novices who don't have much to start a podcast channel. But for beginners with a little more money to spend, you can invest in the following standard podcast start-up package.

## Part 3: Standard Podcast Start-up Package for Novices

This standard podcast start-up package for novices is great for folks who don't have much money to spend on starting a podcast. However, some of the items we recommend here are what you already have (one of them is the mobile phone you're using now), so you might need to purchase a few items worth a few dollars.

| **Standard Podcast Start-up Package for Novices** |                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Equipment**                                     | **Price**                                          |
| **Microphone**                                    | Free (smartphone's earphones also function) to $70 |
| **Computer**                                      | Free (if you already have one) to $300             |
| **Recording & Editing Software**                  | Free                                               |
| **Headphones**                                    | $30                                                |
| **Total Amount**                                  | $60 - $400                                         |

Part 1: A podcast checklist before podcasting

Podcasting is not a cost-money thing compared to starting a YouTube channel. Here is a to-do list for a successful podcast channel. We've also indicated the ones that require money and the ones that do not.

| **Checklist**                       | **Need Money or Not** |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Plan Your Podcast                   | No                    |
| Create A Podcast Brand              | No                    |
| Setup Your Equipment                | Yes                   |
| Choose Your Recording Software      | Yes                   |
| Prepare for Your Podcast Recordings | No                    |
| Record A Few First Episodes         | No                    |
| Edit Your Podcast Recordings        | No                    |
