## How to Rip Copy-Protected DVDs with Handbrake on Mac & Windows 

To remove copy protections on DVDs using Handbrake, you will need the Handbrake copy protection plugin called Libdvdcss. Libdvdcss is a free and open-source software library developed for decoding DVDs with CSS (Content Scramble System). It is specifically used by Handbrake to copy DVDs protected by CSS and region codes. Now, let's learn how to use Handbrake to decrypt DVDs on both Mac and Windows operating systems.

### First, install and download libdvdcss to copy protected DVDs with Handbrake

**On Windows:** 

Step 1: To download libdvdcss for Handbrake protection removal on Windows (Win 11/10 incl.), click here and choose to [download libdvdcss for 32-bit](https://download.videolan.org/libdvdcss/1.2.12/win32/libdvdcss-2.dll) or [download libdvdcss for 64-bit](https://download.videolan.org/libdvdcss/1.2.12/win64/libdvdcss-2.dll).

Step 2: Copy the libdvdcss-2.dll to the Handbrake program folder, which is normally located at C:\\Program Files\\Handbrake. Please don't rename the libdvdcss file. 

![Download libdvdcss for Handbrake copy protection](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/libdvdcss-download.jpg) 

Download libdvdcss on Windows

**On macOS:** 

To download Handbrake Libdvdcss Mac for protection removal on Mac, you can install Homebrew and use it to automatically download libdvdcss ([Learn detailed steps to download libdvdcss on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)). You can also manually download libdvdcss on Mac. Simply note to place the library in placing the folder /usr/local/lib instead of /usr/lib. Handbrake can then detect it and use it to rip copy-protected DVDs.

Just open a Terminal and run the following commands:

_cd /usr/local/lib_ 
 _sudo curl -O https://download.videolan.org/libdvdcss/1.2.12/macosx/libdvdcss.2.dylib_

**Tips:** If that won't work, run the command _sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib_ to install the libdvdcss. You'd better download both the latest version of Handbrake (1.6.1) and Libdvdcss. To fix Handbrake copy protection removal failed on Mac Sonoma, you can either leave SIP that removes Libdvdcss disabled and reinstall Libdvdcss or move the downloaded Libdvdcss to /usr/local/lib.

### Step 1\. Load the copy-protected DVD to Handbrake 

With libdvdcss installed on your Mac (or Windows), you can use Handbrake to rip DVDs with copy protections. Insert DVD, click "Open Source" to load the DVD. The libdvdcss library will run in the background to help Handbrake remove the copy protection and identify the correct title of an encrypted DVD. This process may take several seconds. 

_**Note:** If it fails to read the DVD, check if the libdvdcss is installed correctly. Here's this [Handbrake Libdvdcss errors fix](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) can help when you have problems. Even with libdvdcss installed correctly, Handbrake may still fail to handle a DVD protected by modern encryption schemes._

### Step 2\. Select the quality preset 

Next, you need to specify the quality of the ripped DVD. Open the dropdown menu of Preset, Handbrake offers presets for General, Web, Devies, Makoska, and Production. Generally, when you try to rip a DVD, you'd better choose the 480P or 576P preset for the best result.

Now, under the Video option, choose a format from the Video Encoder dropdown menu. Handbrake can convert the protected DVD to H.264, H.265, MPEG-4, etc. There are also options to set the ripping quality, adjust the resolutions, deinterlace, crop, change the bitrate, etc.

##  Most Reliable Solution when Handbrake can't Remove Copy Protection

![note icon](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../image-style/new-seo/icon0.png)

Even with libdvdcss downloaded and installed, you may still meet errors when ripping DVDs with copy protections using Handbrake. That is because the libdvdcss was designed to access DVDs encrypted with the Content Scramble System (CSS). Handbrake can't handle DVD copy protections other than CSS with libdvdcss and may produce errors like:

_\* Handbrake can't find the correct title saying no valid source found;_ 
 _\* The conversion is incomplete as Handbrake rips only part of the DVDs;_ 
 _\* The output MP4 video is blocky, pixellated, and otherwise distorted;_ 
_\* Handbrake freezes, stutters, or crashes when ripping the DVD;_ 
_\* The ripped subtitles appear faint and barely readable and foreign audio subtitles won't work;_ 
 _\* The resulting file is double the size and the rip itself takes twice as long;_ 
 _\* The ripped DVD video contains several KBs only and won't play;_ 
_\* After the rip, the encoded videos turn out badly pixilated..._

In this case, you can first check and try: 

● Check if your DVD or the DVD drive is damaged or outdated.   
 ● Check if there is a technical issue or bug with your HandBrake installation and re-download Handbrake.   
 ● Disable any third-party software in the background when ripping DVDs with Handbrake to avoid high CPU usage.  
 ● Try the Handbrake hardware encoder for the DVD ripping.  
 ● HandBrake supports a variety of formats, but if your DVD is in a format that is not supported, it might not be able to rip it.

If libdvdcss and Handbrake still can't remove copy protection, try **[MacX DVD Ripper Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)**. Unlike Handbrake, it can bypass DVD copy protection restrictions like CSS, Region Code (1-6), Disney DRM, Sony ArccOS, UOPs, and almost all the copy protections on the market. You can rip copy-protected DVDs without Handbrake libdvdcss to MP4, HEVC, MPEG4, MOV, M4V, WMV, AVI, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, webs, and 350+ formats. There are unique features to copy protected DVDs to ISO image, MKV, MPG with original output quality. 

No more Handbrake copy protection removal hassles and no extra plugin is required to copy protected DVDs.
