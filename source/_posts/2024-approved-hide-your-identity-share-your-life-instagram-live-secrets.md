One way to mask your identity while watching live streams on Instagram is to create a brand new blank account.

##### Step1 Use A Temporary Email Generator

Since the commonly used emails are limited to creating only one Instagram account, and you might not need a new account frequently, you can try creating a temporary mailbox.

To do so, visit the [**Temp Mail**](https://temp-mail.org/en/) website, and you will get a new temporary email address. Copy the address and use it to create an Instagram account for the next step.

### Method 3\. Watch The Live Replay

It is possible to avoid the streamer’s live stream at all and use “Live Replay” to view it anonymously. However, this can only happen if the streamer you follow has turned on the "Save Replay" feature.

Here's how you can watch the Instagram live replay:

Step1 Launch the [Instagram](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android&hl=en&gl=US) app and sign in to your account.

Step2 Search for the profile of your favorite **Instagram live streamer.**

Step3 Check out their story and if they’ve shared their live video link, tap the **“Play”** button. You can now watch the replay while browsing through the likes and comments.
