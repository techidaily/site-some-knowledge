After we've paid money for a Kindle book, we are only allowed to download and read them on Amazon supported devices and apps. In other words, we don't truly own it. That's because Amazon add Kindle DRM to their digital books. So if we want to read our purchased Kindle books more freely, the Kindle DRM Removal [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) is a must-have tool for every Kindle ebook owner.

### What is Kindle DRM?

Kindle DRM is a "Digital Rights Management" technology adopted by Amazon Kindle. Maybe it is difficult for our customers to understand what it is on earth, but I think you may start to know it after reading the below examples.![kindle drm](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle-drm.png)

1\. You buy a Kindle book and transfer it to iTunes, but iBooks told you that you can't open this book because of DRM!

2\. You find an interesting Kindle book and you can't help sharing it with your best friend, but when he tries to open it Amazon ask him to purchase the copy!

3\. Amazon may delete your purchases (and even your account) from your Kindle Cloud without notifying. So some Kindle ebook buyers may find that their purchased books are disappeared from Kindle Cloud suddenly!

Yes, this is Kindle DRM. Kindle DRM definitely has no benefit but only inconvenience for ebook readers.

### Why We Need Kindle DRM Removal?

At first, please download Epubor Ultimate to your Windows/Mac computer.

* Customer service: Yes.
* User-friendly interface: Yes.
* Automatically detect device and books: Yes.
* Technical support: Yes, it's free.

There are two methods to remove DRM from Kindle books with Epubor Ultimate. 

### Method 1\. Remove Kindle DRM from Kindle for PC/Mac

This is most universal method to remove Kindle DRM, as you don't have to own a Kindle e-ink device. You just need a computer and the Kindle desktop reading app.

[_Kindle for PC V2.4.0 Download_](https://download.epubor.com/KindleForPC-installer-2.4.0-70904.exe) [_Kindle for Mac V1.40 Download_](https://download.epubor.com/KindleForMac-installer-1.40.dmg)

We highly recommend you download the Kindle PC or Mac app from the above link (the exe or zip/dmg package file directly). Don't download the app from Microsoft app store or Mac App store. 

#### Step 1\. Register Kindle app.

Run Kindle for PC/Mac, and then log in with your Amazon account.

![sign in kindle](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/sign-in-kindle.png)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Soon you will see your own Kindle library. These books are what you've bought from the Amazon Kindle store in your account.

#### Step 2\. Download Kindle books to your PC/Mac.

In the Kindle library, right-click the book cover and then choose "Download". For successfully removing kindle DRM, you need to make sure that the books have been downloaded to your local computer. In other words, you must make sure you can see these books in the "Downloaded" tab.

![download kindle books](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/download-kindle-books.png)

#### Step 3\. Run Epubor Ultimate to remove Kindle DRM.

Now launch Epubor Ultimate, and you will see the clean interface. This tool shows your kindle library clearly at the left side. It also can automatically detect all your Kindle books that are downloaded via Kindle for PC/Mac.

Now just drag them from the left side to the right area. Epubor Ultimate will help you remove DRM from kindle books in batch immediately. When finished, you can click on the word "Decrypted" to open the output folder.

In most cases, the book format (originally was .azw) will not change after the DRM is removed. The AZW format is rarely supported by other ebook reading apps. So it's highly recommended to convert the ebook to ePub, PDF, Mobi, or TXT as per your own need.

##### I am running the latest version of Kindle for PC/Mac version. When I remove the Kindle DRM, Epubor Ultimate tells it's failed. Why? How to solve the problem?

**Solution 1:** Usually, you can follow this general guide: [Kindle KFX DRM Removal Failed and Solution \[Updated 2023\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) to get your kindle books decrypted and converted successfully.

**Solution 2:**If you happen to encounter the Kindle KCR files on Mac, please follow this guide: [how to decrypt kindle kcr file and convert kcr to pdf](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). 

### Method 2\. Remove Kindle DRM from Kindle E-ink Device

This method will be much easier than Method 1 if you own a Kindle e-ink eReader, as this Epubor Ultimate can detect the device and sync books automatically. And there is no need to install the Kindle for PC or Mac app. 

#### Step 1\. Download books to Kindle E-ink device.

On Kindle there are some books are saved in "Cloud", and others are saved on "On Device". So for successfully DRM removing, it is necessary to download your kindle books to kindle device.

![downloaded to kindle e-ink](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/downloaded-to-kindle.png)

#### Step 2\. Plug in your Kindle to computer and run Epubor Ultimate.

Connect your Kindle to computer with USB cable and run Epubor Ultimate. Soon on the left side layout you will see your device and your book files list. 

#### Step 3\. Drag Kindle books from left side to the right blank area.

Select the books and drag them to the right blank area. You will be surprised that this software can remove DRM so fast without inputting Kindle Serial Number! In fact it can read the basic information of your Kindle when detecting your device, including the Kindle Serial Number.

Since 2018, Amazon has released its new firmware 5.10.2 and above until now, which makes it impossible for us to directly remove DRM from kindle devices.

**Now the solution** is to download your Kindle books from the Amazon website page via "**[Download & Transfer via USB](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)**". The books you downloaded from the Amazon website will be AZW3 format. Then you just need to plug your Kindle e-ink device and then add those downloaded AZW3 books to Epubor Ultimate. In this way, the DRM will be successfully removed with the help of a Kindle device. Below is a short video guide you can follow.

### Use Epubor Ultimate For Yourself Only, Not For Piracy

Even though there are a lot of reasons that we need Epubor Ultimate for better reading, but the basic principle is - We must use it just for ourselves!

The key to removing Kindle DRM is based on your own purchases, and this is also the reason why this tool requires you to log in to your amazon account or KSN. They are all linked to your Amazon account.

You can transfer your books to multiple different devices, back up your kindle books, share them with your friends, and so on. But no reselling!

Hi -- until yesterday epubor seemed to be able to decrypt encrypted azw files but now I'm needing to use the kindle app and have epubor convert these files to epub. That works but the output files seem inordinately large. Did something change with azw files do you know? there have been a couple of kindle updates so maybe that is involved?

Thanks for using our software!  
 We can't decrypt Kindle books in iOS system(iPod) directly, but you can sync books to your computer, then Epubor software can decrypt them.

 1, Download and install Kindle for PC/MAC;  
 2, Authorize Kindle software with your amazon ID, and sync all books to computer, make sure you can read all ebooks.  
 3, Run Epubor software, drag the books to Left panel, all done.

 Enjoy

Other files from other sites downloaded just fine, no errors on running setup files. Downloaded .exe file second time, thinking maybe first download was corrupted - same result.

Because Kindle for PC/Mac has automatically upgrade to v1.19, that makes kindle books are changed to KFX file format.   
 Please downgrade to v1.17 or older version.

**For decrypting books from Kindle device:**  
1, Connect Kindle to computer with USB cable.  
2, Directly drag the books from rightside column into leftside main window.  
  
**For decrypting books from Kindle for PC/Mac:**  
1, Download and authorize Kindle for PC/Mac with your Amazon ID.  
2, Launch Kindle for PC/Mac, sync all books to your computer and make sure you can read all the books.  
3, Run Epubor software, all done.

As of Sept 12, 2017, recent Kindle purchases failed to be converted by this program. I suspect this is because of a change in encryption scheme by Amazon. At least when served to the Mac version of their Kindle app. So caveat emptor: the Epubor's application is now mostly useless, until they catch up to Amazon

Hei, thanks for your guide. I was able to drm some Kindle book I want to save. Now I have a \_nodrm.azw file on my pc. The issue is to visualize them on my Android phone. I tried with librera but the book loads but I don't see anything (just a number code, no title, no cover). Do you think it's safe to visualize them on Kindle app for Android registered with my amazon account? I mean, it seems to me a bit silly using their invasive app for reading a stripped book from their catalog... Plus: I store these books on Drive, ho could I open it with Kindle for Android. I'm a little bit confused sorry.  
 (converting to ePub isn't a solution because I need to save index structure of these books. I easily read the ePub version on any reader, but without any internal content organization it's just a mess!)

I don't own a Kindle device, but I have bought some books to read on the Kindle app installed on my iPad, iPhone, and Mac; now I want to read them on the Kobo Aura, but, of course, there is no way to convert those files because of DRM... I tried to follow Method #1 — install an earlier version of the Kindle App. Well, under macOS Catalina, the old version (being 32-bits) will not run. Downgrading is always a bad idea — there are good reasons for Amazon having released a newer version! I could, in theory, install an older version of macOS (like Mojave), which ought to run the old Kindle app, but that is really demanding too much!

 There is no issue with your application (it runs perfectly under macOS Catalina); it's just that you're 'demanding' an environment which is simply not reasonable in 2020.

Congratulations. Well done guides. Really useful, practical guidance. I look forward to exploring it.

 One immediate question - we get "free" books (actually it's they are rented book, free under Kindle Unlimited) which have to be returned to allow the downloading of other additional books (limit is 10 books at any given time). We have a Kindle Paperwhite (wife's ereader) and A Kobo Aura (my ereader). Some Kindle Unlimited books we get "free" may be a good read for me but ... if we transfer it out of Kindle to eventually find its way to the Kobo, is there a practical safe method to return it later to Amazon?

 We are in Canada and ebooks from our library can download to our Kobo through the legacy Overdrive app (Libby doesn't work here although it is apparently used in the U.S. library systems). The books come through to us as ACSM files. I believe the Overdrive ebooks can find their way to the Kindle reader but we still have to test this.

 We look forward to your comments on the question regarding Kindle Unlimited books travelling to Kobo and whether there is a feasible return trip to the Kindle reader and ultimately return the to Amazon Canada.

 Thank you!

I use the trial version of Ultimate and go through the process of removing DRM on a Kindle (downloaded with the old version). It says "decrypted" with the green check. But all of the content just has the text below. There is nothing more, not any 20% of ebook content. Did it really decrypt the file? If I buy the license, and find out it doesn't decrypt more of the book, I will have wasted my money. Please let my know that the DRM is really being removed and I will be able to see the content.

Hi Everyone, I manage to get it all working and well.

 First, download epubor ultimate and set-up and get a license to support the company! :) I am using Epubor ultimate 3.0.13.719 at the time of this writing.

 Second, download Kindle for PC (win-10, i tried it with ver 1.32.0(6119)) and register with my amazon account as per guide above. you can refresh and see your books, but please don't download any books.

 Then download kfx\_begone command prompt tool - https://epubor.com/how-to-deal-with-the-new-kindle-update.html#method1  
 \- VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE:  
 a) make sure kindle app is closed before running the tool. Reason being, the tool will execute Kindle app in a peculiar method, and allow you to download the ebooks you purchased.  
 b) run command prompt with/as administrator mode  
 c) i ran it, with lots of error messages, but eventually, the kindle app loads and the command prompt batch process paused. It typically require 20-40 seconds before it pauses and kindle app loads.

 Once kindle app is launched using the command prompt launch method, you can download the books you want to unlock DRM.

 Then finally, launch epubor ultimate, go to kindle tab, and drag the books you want to free DRM.

 that's it!

 I spent hours figuring things out, i thought the old kindle app refresh (auto-downgrade) was related to my Win10, ran Virtualbox VM and nope, its not related to PC, rather its the Amazon sign-in page that has been 'changed'.

 hope this helps you guys! now i can free up DRM on my kindle books and read with Google Books! Yeay!!!

I spend a great deal of time in environments where I cannot physically read, or even hold, my Kindle reader devices - but I can listen to audiobooks. 

 While Audible and other audiobook formats are great, there are a considerable number of my Ebooks in my Kindle account that I cannot enjoy because I can't read them. 

 The ability to convert them to a DRM free format to be read by my TTS reader (I use Evie) is incredibly beneficial to those of us with poor eyesight and/or no access to the screen or the android native screen reader (which is awful anyway).

 The first book I wanted to listen to converted to ePub flawlessly and Evie reads nicely. Thank you.

 Now we are working on this issue. Once there is a solution, we will let you know. The older kindle books still can be cracked with Epubor Software.

 There is still another way to remove drm from this kind of kindle books if you have any kindle eink device registered with your amazon account. Please download the kindle books via "Download and transfer via usb" and then remove kindle drm with Epubor Ultimate.

Kindle DRM Remover is a software that is designed to remove DRM (Digital Rights Management) from Kindle eBooks. DRM is a digital lock that prevents users from sharing, copying, or printing eBook content. Kindle DRM Remover is designed to remove this lock so that users can transfer, share, and read their eBooks on different devices without restrictions. Another notable advantage of Kindle DRM Remover is that it supports multiple file formats, including PDF, MOBI, AZW, and AZW3\. This software can remove DRM from eBooks purchased from Amazon, but it can also unlock books from other retailers.

It works for regular books but there seems to be no way to download books from Kindle Unlimited. Because downloading from Kindle Unlimited requires the update of the Kindle app. When I try to download the book using Kindle v1.17.0, I'm getting an error:

 "Your Kindle app requires an update to to view this content."

 And the Epubor app doesn't support the book that I download using the latest Kindle app.

Hello,

 Kindle Unlimited is a rental service, so you don't actually own the books. Therefore, Epubor software can't convert Kindle Unlimited books for you. 

 Best regards,

Epubor didn't work to remove Kindle KFX DRM on a Mac. I downloaded version 1.31 of the kindle app and followed every step (like, 5 times). no joy. Crucible couldn't do it either. So frustrating. I just want to be able to convert the book to a pdf so that I can print out pages. (Taking a million screen shots off a kindle app is just not an option.)

"In most cases, the book format (originally was .azw) will not change after the DRM is removed."

 Apparently "most cases" means "not at all" or maybe less than 1% (if I'm being generous and taking a wild guess, because I have not one successful example).  
 Decided to check the software out before purchase, and thank god I did, because I really need one that does not convert the ebooks, when removing DRM. Or at least not convert to epub. Because quite a few of my books have custom fonts and epub cannot handle custom fonts.

Thank you for asking. Your book formatting will not be changed. As for the kindle kfx format, if they are decrypted, they will be in epub format. You can convert it to azw3 or other formats with Epubor Ultimate.
