##  Plenty of Ports With Plenty of Weight

 If you just want some extra power, there are a lot of external batteries out there that can provide plenty of battery life in (mostly) portable enclosures. The Anker Solix C800 Plus is one example, weighing around 24 pounds and featuring five AC outlets and four USB ports. It even has a built-in light that makes it ideal for camping trips.

 On the other side of the spectrum is this EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 which weighs around 113 pounds and has seven AC outlets capable of 4,000W, four USB ports, and a 12V DC out. Yes, it’s a power station, but I’d argue it’s much less portable than the smaller ones.

Close 

 Even with two back wheels and a telescoping handle, the unit is heavy and inconvenient to move around. I briefly attempted to lift it into the trunk of my SUV and then quickly decided against it. I imagine two people could have an easier time putting it in a vehicle, but it would probably always be a chore to haul around.

 Its size and weight might be its defining characteristics. For example, if you live in a second-floor apartment, stairs aren’t an option. It probably won’t be a battery that you’re constantly wheeling around or taking out of the house.

 I kept the Delta Pro 3 in my garage and it was still a bit of a hassle to maneuver from where it was stored to an outlet to charge it. Mostly I had to rely on the telescoping handle to tilt it up and pivot the weight onto its wheels.

 In exchange for a heavy unit, you do get a lot of battery power and plenty of outlets. I liked having all the various options even though most of my use revolved around the standard outlets. With the unit being so big and living in my garage, I found I didn’t use the USB ports as often as I thought I would. They are still handy for charging accessories for bigger items. For example, I have a bike pump that charges via USB-C and I often recharged it with the Delta Pro 3.

##  Charging an EV Is Possible

 With a big, powerful battery comes big powerful charging needs. For some people, it will be keeping a refrigerator going for multiple days. For others, it might be powering an electric oven or air conditioning unit.

 For me, I wanted to try charging a Tesla Model Y from the battery. To do this, I enabled the GFCI/RCD support in the mobile app and plugged in a Gen 2 NEMA 6-20 adapter to the battery and the other end into the car’s NACS port. Tesla lists the adapter as being capable of charging a Model Y at 14 miles of range per hour. That’s exactly the result I saw in the Tesla app, with the vehicle charging at 16A.

 Mostly, I wanted to see if charging an EV from the Delta Pro 3 was possible. It is! It’s far from cost-effective and is not something I’ll often do, possibly ever again. The battery can supply about an hour's worth of power, which means those 14 miles of range per hour are the total capacity the Delta Pro 3 can handle.

 The Delta Pro 3 is an emergency battery and if there was ever a critical failure that left an EV completely depleted, then it could supply enough range to make it to a public charger.

##  Recharging The Delta Pro 3

![back charging inputs](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/back-charging-inputs.JPG) 

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 Sometimes it’s just taken for granted, but once a battery has been used, it needs to be refilled. And a big battery can take a while to be recharged. There are an abundance of ways to recharge the Delta Pro 3 including with solar panels or even from a public EV charger (with an additional accessory).

 I refilled the battery with standard AC wall outlets most of the time. Twice, the battery tripped a circuit in my garage when using its “fast” setting. It was consuming power at a rate of around 1,400W when those incidents happened. The alternative is to flip a small switch on the back of the unit to limit the input level down to around 115W.

 The fastest of those two methods would take just under two hours, while the limited one estimates somewhere around five days—that’s close to 120 hours.

##  The Mobile App Is Mostly For Controls

Close 

 As you might expect from a $3,000 battery, this one has extra technology integrated to make its option more advanced. It features both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for connecting to it remotely and controlling some of its more nuanced features. While I didn't feel the need to constantly use the battery through its app, it did provide a nice way to check its status remotely.

##  Should You Buy the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3?

 I probably could have told you the [EcoFlow Delta Pro 3](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004439/https://us.ecoflow.com/products/delta-pro-3-portable-power-station?variant=41385721004105&g%5Fcampaign%5Fid=16004853777&g%5Fadgroup%5Fid=132278136123) was a beast before seeing it in person. But after spending some time with it, I can indeed confirm it is an ultra-powerful battery.

 I liked its wide range of ports and deep feature set. It’s well suited to handle a lot of different types of emergencies, take on the road in an RV, or do regular house duties. People who have specific places around their house are the ones I’d be more inclined to recommend the Delta Pro 3 to. While the battery has wheels and a handle built into it, it’s still really heavy and can be a pain to move around. I wouldn’t advise most people to plan on moving it frequently.

 If the battery is calling your name, for whatever kind of use, I would act while you might qualify for the government’s rebate credit.
