## The Bottom Line

The good news is that there is a Final Cut Pro trial version available. You can use the trial version for free for 90 days. Thereafter, you have to pay the one-time fee to get full access to Final Cut Pro for a lifetime. There is no doubt that FCP is one of the best video editors. But you should first check out the free version before spending money on the premium version for lifetime access.
