 Samsung is about to host one of the most anticipated launch events of the year. At the mid-year Galaxy Unpacked event on July 10, the company is rumored to unveil the next generation of foldables, a brand-new wearable ring, new smartwatches, and wireless earbuds. Let's take a closer look!

##  How to Watch the Galaxy Unpacked Event on July 10?

 To watch the [Galaxy Unpacked event on Wednesday, July 10](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-elite-selection-of-top-12-tycoons-perfect-for-strategic-souls/), at 9 AM ET, which will take place in Paris, users can tune into the live stream on the company's [official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWwgaK7x0%5FFR1goeSRazfsQ). The company will also be uploaded tons of press releases and photos on social media during the event for those who are interested.

##  Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 Could Arrive With Incremental Updates

 Samsung is expected to unveil the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy Z Flip 6, and according to the rumor mill (which includes official-looking spec sheets for both models), both handsets will ship with several upgrades. Further, there has been some chatter about additional Fold models, like the Z Fold 6 FE or the Z Fold 6 Ultra, which, at the moment, is the most exciting bit about Samsung's summer launch.

 The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 could ship with a 6.3-inch outer display and a 7.6-inch foldable inner display. However, the phone could have a slightly different aspect ratio than its predecessor, giving it a square-like shape (much like what we've seen on the OnePlus Open). Under the hood, the foldable could feature [the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC](https://ai-video-translation.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-translate-video-from-japanese-to-english-online-for-free/), one of the most powerful chips on Android phones. We've already seen the chipset on handsets like the [Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-profit-strategies-for-vimeo-content-creators/) or the [OnePlus 12](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-apple-id-from-apple-iphone-15-pro-without-password-by-drfone-ios/). Besides, the phone could carry the same triple camera setup and battery as the [Galaxy Z Fold 5](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfecting-the-art-of-compelling-mosaic-imagery/).

 Something worth highlighting is how the leaked promotional material compares the Galaxy Z Fold 6 to the Z Fold 5, stating that the former weighs 14 grams lighter, has a bigger outer display, and measures thinner (12.1mm) when folded. This could be a response to the Chinese manufacturers' recent models, which feature more capable hardware while maintaining a slimmer form factor. Last but not least, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 could sport a new hinge and an IP48 dust and water resistance rating (a big improvement from Z Fold 5's IPX8 rating).

 The Galaxy Z Flip 6 will ship with a 3.4-inch cover screen and a 6.7-inch inner foldable display. Underneath the shiny exterior, the phone will also feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC. What catches the eye, though, is that the company might have managed to equip the flip-style phone with a larger 4,000 mAh battery while shaving off 0.2mm from its thickness. Optics on the Z Flip 6 could also see an upgrade, as the smartphone could feature an upgraded 50MP primary sensor and a 12MP telephoto shooter.

##  Samsung Could Also Push New Galaxy AI Features

 Although the hardware updates might not sound impressive, Samsung could make a big deal of the software improvements. We also expect some [new Galaxy AI features](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevate-your-content-game-with-these-instagram-story-tips/) specially curated for the foldables. Further, the company should also announce more AI-based features for its wearables, including the new Galaxy Ring, Galaxy Watch 7, and the Galaxy Buds 3 series.

##  The Galaxy Ring Looks Promising

 First teased at the Galaxy Unpacked event in January, the Galaxy Ring will be the first-of-its-kind device from Samsung. Competing with the Oura Ring and similar devices, the [Galaxy Ring will ship with plenty of health monitoring features](https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-youtube-marketing-key-methods-for-attracting-viewers/). It is said to come equipped with an ECG sensor, a blood oxygen sensor, a sensor for blood pressure/flow measurement, and a PPG sensor that checks irregular heart rhythms.

 Interestingly, the Galaxy Ring could also come with a sleep monitoring feature, which would keep a comprehensive record of different sleep-related metrics, such as heart rate and respiratory rate. The company would also integrate the device with [Samsung Health](https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-harmony-and-code-the-elite-circle-s-digital-compositional-geniuses/) and Samsung Food, harnessing data from other devices to draw patterns and come up with crucial insights into users' health. However, users might have to wait to utilize some features as they would need FDA approval.

 The device's battery life could last up to nine days on a charge. However, the exact battery life depends on the models that users purchase and how they use them.

##  Samsung Could Launch Its First "Ultra" Smartwatch

 The Galaxy Unpacked could also witness two new Samsung smartwatches: Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch Ultra. Most recently, the company's semiconductor division [released a new W1000 chipset](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsemiconductor.samsung.com%2Fprocessor%2Fwearable-processor%2Fexynos-w1000%2F) for wearables, and there's a good chance that it will power the upcoming smartwatches. While the Galaxy Watch 7 will retain a familiar design and aesthetic, it is the Galaxy Watch Ultra that everyone wants to know more about.

 So apparently, Samsung is going to release a souped-up version of the Galaxy Watch this year, with a bigger screen, battery, and a heftier exterior shell. It is clear that the smartwatch will take on the [Apple Watch Ultra](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-mastering-your-youtube-pinpointing-a-specialized-audience/), but there isn't much information, except that Samsung's model will feature a 100-meter water resistance, making it fit for recreational diving or other activities that involve exposure to high-velocity water.

 Some rumors also suggest that the smartwatch could come with a blood sugar monitoring system. If Samsung pulls it off, the feature will give the Galaxy Watch Ultra over Apple's Watch Ultra.

##  AirPods-Like Galaxy Buds 3 Could Also Show Up

 At the Galaxy Unpacked summer event, Samsung could also take the curtains off the new Galaxy Buds lineup. Recent rumors indicate the existence of two models: the regular Galaxy Buds 3 and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. This time, Samsung has opted for a more AirPods Pro-like design for its wireless earbuds.

 Recently, hands-on images of the Buds 3 Pro surfaced online, showcasing the earphones in a dark gray color. The photos also reveal the presence of glowing LED strips on the device, along with a new see-through lid. Both models could also get their own AI-based features to enhance call quality or noise cancelation.
