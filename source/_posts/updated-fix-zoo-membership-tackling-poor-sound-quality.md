## What is Zoom?

Developed by Zoom Video Communications, Zoom is a communications application that allows users to set up virtual audio and video conferencing, live chats, webinars, screen-sharing, and other collaborative capabilities. This proprietary videotelephony software program is compatible with Android, iOS, Linux, Windows, and Mac.

The free plan permits a maximum of 100 concurrent participants, with a time restriction of 40 minutes. Users can subscribe to a paid plan and upgrade, with the highest plan supporting 1,000 concurrent participants for meetings that last up to 30 hours.

This video chat software exploded in popularity in such a short period that it's hard to realize it's just been around since 2013\. Zoom grew in part due to potential roadblocks during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the disease traveled rapidly across the United States. Zoom was one of the few services that didn't go down, and it might have survived if it hadn't exploded in popularity.

Despite first impressions, Zoom's success throughout the epidemic was due to its communication capacity. Its popularity can also be attributed to its basic design and user-friendly interface. It provides a simple option to compose a message once the chat has begun and a simple way to leave messages. A group chat feature also allows you to add several persons at once.

Zoom's popularity was assisted by its simplicity during the pandemic. Instead of complicated features like those present in Snapchat, the app provides straightforward functionality that consumers can grasp. And, when it comes to cross-platform software, this will undoubtedly impress some, given that people are increasingly spending hours each day on their phones.

It's hard to think that a simple video chat software has gained much traction. This, however, can be linked to Covid-19 and its rapid infection spread. During this time, Zoom was one of the few operational services. As a result, it became a highly easy means for people to communicate.

Zoom's success during the Covid-19 pandemic and recent success is not ignorable. It's by no surprise that they created a simple interface with simple capabilities to aid in propagating the virus during the crisis. We should see more of their services in the future, especially during purges like this one.

## Solutions for All Types of Zoom Audio Issues

From time to time, you might experience Zoom audio issues. The good news is: There is a solution to each problem that you will encounter during Zoom sessions. Here are some common issues and how to fix them.

### 1\. Audio Distorted

If you experience Zoom audio distortion you need to go to your Device Manager and click the Sound, Video, and Game Controllers option. Uninstall Realtek High Definition Audio and restart your PC. Go back to Device Manager and go to Sound, Video, and Game Controllers; reinstall Realtek High Definition Audio online.

You can then head to the Zoom platform and download and install the latest Zoom Client. You can now enjoy your Zoom sessions without experiencing audio distortion.


![zoom audio distorted issue](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/zoom-audio-distorted-1.png)

### 2\. Faulty Microphone Setup

A malfunctioning microphone can cause problems, like fuzzy recordings, poor quality videos, dropped calls, and more. Let's see how you can fix faulty microphone setups when using Zoom.


![zoom audio distorted issue - faulty microphone setup](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/zoom-audio-distorted-2.png)

#### \- Make Sure Your Voice Is Audible

Voicing is one of the most significant factors that can cause a faulty setup. You should set the visual aspect of the camera just right to capture your voice.

Zoom also requests access to the microphone before you join a meeting. Select the Join Audio option at the bottom of your Zoom window and ensure the mic is suited for your application.

The microphone should send out a clear and robust sound if you're recording a narration or voiceover. However, with Zoom Recorders, your setup must be right on point and match your project type.

#### \- Make Sure the Microphone Is Connected and Turned on

Check your Bluetooth settings if you're using a wireless mic, or examine the connecting cable if you're using an external mic. For wired mics, you could plug it into another USB port. If you're using Bluetooth devices, ensure the battery is charged.

#### \- Make Sure Your Mic Is Selected

Always select the up arrow located next to the mic icon during a zoom meeting and ensure the desired mic is chosen.


![zoom audio distorted issue - ensure mic selection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/zoom-audio-distorted-3.png)

#### \- Make Sure You Are Not Muted

If the mic icon shows a line through it in the Zoom window, you want to select the Sound icon as this will allow you to unmute yourself.

#### \- Check Your Device Settings

Head to your device's setting and make sure your microphone is enabled. Be sure to select the audio input that you want in Mac and set up your microphone in Windows correctly.

#### \- Check Your App Permission

Head to your device's app setting and make sure Zoom has permission to access the microphone.


![zoom audio distorted issue - check app permission](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/zoom-audio-distorted-4.png)

### 3\. Unreliable Internet Connection

Sometimes, you might need to use Zoom over the internet for obvious reasons. In some cases, your internet connection may be unstable and cause problems with your Zoom session. Here is how to fix the unreliability of your Internet Connection while using Zoom.

#### \- Uninstall Software

Uninstall any software related to your internet service provider on your devices, such as BQE and Speedtouch. You should check third-party software in case of problems.

#### \- Reset Your Modem

Power off your modem, wait for a while, power it again, and check if the internet connection is stable. If there is still no improvement, try to reboot your computer and turn off the power again without getting into Windows. It may help reset the system.

#### \- Check Your Network Adapter

If the problem persists, check your network adapter driver. It may be corrupted or broken. Ensure that you are using software updated drivers and check if you can edit them. If not, replace your network adapter. Once this is done, restart your computer and check if the internet connection is reliable. If not, continue and shut down several times to fix the issue entirely or until it works properly.

## Tips to Avoid Audio Issues while Using Zoom

During video meetings, poor audio quality is troublesome. Luckily, the problem is usually easily solvable. Check out these five tips that will help you avoid having audio issues during your next Zoom session.

#### 1\. Check the Background Noise of Your Room and Try To Mitigate It

A noisy environment will impact the audio quality of any device, including your computer's microphone or your camera's built-in microphone. Background noise may also include noises from external sources such as passing traffic, construction work, a beeping microwave oven, or even a whirring refrigerator.

Try to find a quiet room or a relatively noise-free place if you can. It can help reduce background noise and the echo effect it produces.


![tips to avoid audio issue](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/zoom-audio-distorted-5.png)

#### 2\. Maintain a Stable Internet Connection

It is advisable to have a stable internet connection to avoid audio hiccups. If you use a wireless router, ensure that the other connected devices won't produce any disruptions. The same thing goes with a wired connection.

#### 3\. Use the Right Equipment

We recommend you use an external microphone because it will produce a clear sound. If you don't have an external microphone, a computer microphone is good, but use one that can be detached and plugged in with a cable.


![tips to avoid audio issue - use the right equipment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/zoom-audio-distorted-6.png)

#### 4\. Go Pro

Zoom provides pro solutions such as Steinberg's VST Connect, specially designed to cope with audio issues. Consider adding these to your Zoom package.


![tips to avoid audio issue - be professional](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/zoom-audio-distorted-7.png)

#### 5\. Learn How to Troubleshoot

Audio issues can occur anytime, anywhere, and in any Zoom session. The only way to deal with them is through troubleshooting. There are plenty of resources online that can help you learn more about troubleshooting in Zoom.

## What is Zoom?

Developed by Zoom Video Communications, Zoom is a communications application that allows users to set up virtual audio and video conferencing, live chats, webinars, screen-sharing, and other collaborative capabilities. This proprietary videotelephony software program is compatible with Android, iOS, Linux, Windows, and Mac.

The free plan permits a maximum of 100 concurrent participants, with a time restriction of 40 minutes. Users can subscribe to a paid plan and upgrade, with the highest plan supporting 1,000 concurrent participants for meetings that last up to 30 hours.

This video chat software exploded in popularity in such a short period that it's hard to realize it's just been around since 2013\. Zoom grew in part due to potential roadblocks during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the disease traveled rapidly across the United States. Zoom was one of the few services that didn't go down, and it might have survived if it hadn't exploded in popularity.

Despite first impressions, Zoom's success throughout the epidemic was due to its communication capacity. Its popularity can also be attributed to its basic design and user-friendly interface. It provides a simple option to compose a message once the chat has begun and a simple way to leave messages. A group chat feature also allows you to add several persons at once.

Zoom's popularity was assisted by its simplicity during the pandemic. Instead of complicated features like those present in Snapchat, the app provides straightforward functionality that consumers can grasp. And, when it comes to cross-platform software, this will undoubtedly impress some, given that people are increasingly spending hours each day on their phones.

It's hard to think that a simple video chat software has gained much traction. This, however, can be linked to Covid-19 and its rapid infection spread. During this time, Zoom was one of the few operational services. As a result, it became a highly easy means for people to communicate.

Zoom's success during the Covid-19 pandemic and recent success is not ignorable. It's by no surprise that they created a simple interface with simple capabilities to aid in propagating the virus during the crisis. We should see more of their services in the future, especially during purges like this one.

## Solutions for All Types of Zoom Audio Issues

From time to time, you might experience Zoom audio issues. The good news is: There is a solution to each problem that you will encounter during Zoom sessions. Here are some common issues and how to fix them.

### 1\. Audio Distorted

If you experience Zoom audio distortion you need to go to your Device Manager and click the Sound, Video, and Game Controllers option. Uninstall Realtek High Definition Audio and restart your PC. Go back to Device Manager and go to Sound, Video, and Game Controllers; reinstall Realtek High Definition Audio online.

You can then head to the Zoom platform and download and install the latest Zoom Client. You can now enjoy your Zoom sessions without experiencing audio distortion.

### 2\. Faulty Microphone Setup

A malfunctioning microphone can cause problems, like fuzzy recordings, poor quality videos, dropped calls, and more. Let's see how you can fix faulty microphone setups when using Zoom.


![zoom audio distorted issue - faulty microphone setup](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/zoom-audio-distorted-2.png)

#### \- Make Sure Your Voice Is Audible

Voicing is one of the most significant factors that can cause a faulty setup. You should set the visual aspect of the camera just right to capture your voice.

Zoom also requests access to the microphone before you join a meeting. Select the Join Audio option at the bottom of your Zoom window and ensure the mic is suited for your application.

The microphone should send out a clear and robust sound if you're recording a narration or voiceover. However, with Zoom Recorders, your setup must be right on point and match your project type.

#### \- Make Sure the Microphone Is Connected and Turned on

Check your Bluetooth settings if you're using a wireless mic, or examine the connecting cable if you're using an external mic. For wired mics, you could plug it into another USB port. If you're using Bluetooth devices, ensure the battery is charged.

#### \- Make Sure Your Mic Is Selected

Always select the up arrow located next to the mic icon during a zoom meeting and ensure the desired mic is chosen.


![zoom audio distorted issue - ensure mic selection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/zoom-audio-distorted-3.png)

#### \- Make Sure You Are Not Muted

If the mic icon shows a line through it in the Zoom window, you want to select the Sound icon as this will allow you to unmute yourself.

#### \- Check Your Device Settings

Head to your device's setting and make sure your microphone is enabled. Be sure to select the audio input that you want in Mac and set up your microphone in Windows correctly.

#### \- Check Your App Permission

Head to your device's app setting and make sure Zoom has permission to access the microphone.

### 3\. Unreliable Internet Connection

Sometimes, you might need to use Zoom over the internet for obvious reasons. In some cases, your internet connection may be unstable and cause problems with your Zoom session. Here is how to fix the unreliability of your Internet Connection while using Zoom.

#### \- Uninstall Software

Uninstall any software related to your internet service provider on your devices, such as BQE and Speedtouch. You should check third-party software in case of problems.

#### \- Reset Your Modem

Power off your modem, wait for a while, power it again, and check if the internet connection is stable. If there is still no improvement, try to reboot your computer and turn off the power again without getting into Windows. It may help reset the system.

#### \- Check Your Network Adapter

If the problem persists, check your network adapter driver. It may be corrupted or broken. Ensure that you are using software updated drivers and check if you can edit them. If not, replace your network adapter. Once this is done, restart your computer and check if the internet connection is reliable. If not, continue and shut down several times to fix the issue entirely or until it works properly.

## Tips to Avoid Audio Issues while Using Zoom

During video meetings, poor audio quality is troublesome. Luckily, the problem is usually easily solvable. Check out these five tips that will help you avoid having audio issues during your next Zoom session.

#### 1\. Check the Background Noise of Your Room and Try To Mitigate It

A noisy environment will impact the audio quality of any device, including your computer's microphone or your camera's built-in microphone. Background noise may also include noises from external sources such as passing traffic, construction work, a beeping microwave oven, or even a whirring refrigerator.

Try to find a quiet room or a relatively noise-free place if you can. It can help reduce background noise and the echo effect it produces.


![tips to avoid audio issue](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/zoom-audio-distorted-5.png)

#### 2\. Maintain a Stable Internet Connection

It is advisable to have a stable internet connection to avoid audio hiccups. If you use a wireless router, ensure that the other connected devices won't produce any disruptions. The same thing goes with a wired connection.

#### 3\. Use the Right Equipment

We recommend you use an external microphone because it will produce a clear sound. If you don't have an external microphone, a computer microphone is good, but use one that can be detached and plugged in with a cable.

#### 4\. Go Pro

Zoom provides pro solutions such as Steinberg's VST Connect, specially designed to cope with audio issues. Consider adding these to your Zoom package.

#### 5\. Learn How to Troubleshoot

Audio issues can occur anytime, anywhere, and in any Zoom session. The only way to deal with them is through troubleshooting. There are plenty of resources online that can help you learn more about troubleshooting in Zoom.
