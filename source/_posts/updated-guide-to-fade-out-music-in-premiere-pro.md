When it comes to joining two different audios or chopping an audio file, all editors use some effects to cover up the joint.

In case you are using Premiere Pro and thinking of using the crossfade audio transition, you will have three options, such as –

● Constant power

● Constant gain

● Exponential fade

All these three options are leading to different effects. Now, it depends on the track and its nature and how it does it work on the video and audience. You should choose one option carefully. In case you want to add a quick effect of fade out and in, you should consider constant gain.

All these options will help you work out properly and make things much easier.
