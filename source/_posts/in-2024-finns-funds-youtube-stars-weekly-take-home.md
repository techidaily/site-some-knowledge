Another important factor that makes PewDiePie popular is its regular video upload that keeps the subscribers interested and looking forward to the next one.

In addition to the above, entrepreneurial mind-set, eye-catchy content and visuals, and appreciation towards the fan are some of the many other reasons accounting for the success and popularity of PewDiePie.
