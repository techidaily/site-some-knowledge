These online tools offer multiple photo distortion filters and effects that you can add to your image and distort its look. After applying a filter, you can manually adjust the intensity of your distortion filter to suit your preferences.

Some of the images you can distort using online tools include:

* Over-Exposition: This is when the person in the photo is too bright or overexposed to show the subject's features.
* Under-Exposure: This is when the person in the photo is too dark or under-exposed to show the subject's features.
* Visual Stretching is when you digitally stretch an image to the desired size, sometimes using a "zoom" feature to get closer or broader shots of the subject.

Photomosh.com is one of the online tools that people use to edit images online. You can use it to distort photos to create new visual content that showcases your creativity and personality; this website is user-friendly and allows you to create your photo distortion quickly.

Playing with expressions can be enough to create funny photos.
