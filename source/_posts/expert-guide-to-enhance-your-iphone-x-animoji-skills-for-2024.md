After making people familiar with emojis, here comes Animoji which Apple has attempted to make your facial expressions get mimicked by some popular emojis. Animoji is basically a portmanteau i.e. a word made by blending of two words – ‘Animated’ and ‘Emoji’.

iPhone X has embraced Face ID facial recognition technology which is what this Animoji feature uses. The TrueDepth camera scans a user’s face to make the emojis imitate their expressions. Not just expressions, the Animoji on iPhone X matches exactly what you say and where your face position is and how you move your head.

Currently there are 12 emoji characters that work this way. However, 4 more are expected to come soon with the new update of iOS 11.3\. Right now, the users can take delight with animals including panda, cat, dog or robot or even a pile of poo emoji. Isn’t this interesting? Wouldn’t it be funny to see yourself being an alien or a unicorn uttering your words? But how you can do this? Only by scrolling down!
