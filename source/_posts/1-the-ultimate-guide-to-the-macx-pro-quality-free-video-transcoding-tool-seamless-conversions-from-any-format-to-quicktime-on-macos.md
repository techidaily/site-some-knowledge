## Customer Testimonials

This is a wonderful and useful video tool for me because it is accepts most video formats compared among other QuickTime video converters that I could search. Till now, I have converted two of my Blu-ray discs to QuickTime and now I can watch the HD movie without using my DVD drive or rummage it here and there. I will go on using it for future. Thank you.

I love the crisp video quality that this video converter could offer me, once I was under the wrong impressions that a free video converter could not deliver high quality effect, however, it completed the whole conversion in a short time and the quality looked pretty excellent. I was lucky to find it so early.
