This App allows you to use the streaming video service and is available on tablets, phones and PC. The app remembers where you left off watching and even shows you lists for TV shows and movies. It is likely to be aligned with Xbox app.

#### 5. Microsoft SmartGlass App

![smart](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smart.jpg)

This app enables PCs to connect to and also control the Xbox console. You can also track game player achievements and buy Xbox games online. Since Xbox One doubles up as media box users can also control their TVs from the PC with SmartGlass.

With Windows 10, it is now easy to create several desktops as well as run applications from each, so every desktop is showing only those apps that are running in a particular virtual desktop. In case that you do not want to make use of this feature, you may simply remove the “Task View” button.

#### Installing games on Windows 10

Window 10 is going to have an Xbox App which will integrate Xbox One into the PC. The App will also allow you to access games from Steam as well as Microsoft. What is a really exciting feature is that the App will allow you to play on Xbox One with people on the PC version. [Windows game](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Apps store offers a wide range of games both free and paid.

Of course the Microsoft Solitaire Collection as well as the traditional Minesweeper and Hearts are still going to be there and also you’ll be able to have games like the Windows 10 version of ‘Square Enix’s Rise of the Tomb Raider’, a sequel to Tomb raider reboot. Here you will see Lara Croft in Siberia. Also there is ‘Minecraft’ (Mojang) with new features and a reboot of the 90s Killer Instinct. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition is a remake of the original with improved graphics and Dolby surround sound 7.1 while Wasteland 2 is a sequel to their 25 year-old game and is a post-apocalyptic RPG that promises over 80,000 of game-time. Some other popular games that will be available are Fable Legends, Sea of Thieves, Shovel Knight, Pinball FX2, Candy Crush Saga etc.

Any game that has an Xbox logo on it means that it also offers Xbox Live achievements and is synced with you Xbox Live profile. Microsoft is not accepting games from developers without a rating so you can have a look at the rating before you buy a game that is appropriate for you. At the bottom of the page you will also get information about how big the game is and on what devices it will run. The quality of games at the Windows 10 store could pose a challenge for Steam some say!
