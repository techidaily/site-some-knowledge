## Setting up ManyCam

Note 

 Please be aware that **stream keys** and **server URLs** are provided by a streaming platform only. ManyCam doesn’t generate or store them. 

Click on the Stream button to set up your stream:

In the opened window, you can either start streaming to YouTube or Facebook using predefined options available in ManyCam by default or create a new custom RTMP server for your broadcast. To properly set up your Facebook stream, [please refer to this article](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/). To set up YouTube Live, please follow [their official guide](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2474026?hl=en&ref%5Ftopic=9257984).

In case your preferred streaming platform is not on the list of predefined options, please proceed with adding a custom server:

Here, please pick a name for your stream, and enter the server address and a stream key. These settings are provided by the streaming platform. Please refer to their manuals to find them.

Once you finished setting up your stream, simply press **Stream** to go live.

You can later stop your RTMP stream in the same way.

I'm getting a message saying '**Unable to start broadcasting to...'**

Please follow the steps below to troubleshoot this:

1. Check your RTMP server settings, you might have entered an incorrect server address,
2. Go to ManyCam Settings -> Network and make sure “Proxy” is disabled,
3. Check your firewall settings,
4. Check if any other software installed on your machine blocks ManyCam,
5. Make sure your Network Connection is on.
