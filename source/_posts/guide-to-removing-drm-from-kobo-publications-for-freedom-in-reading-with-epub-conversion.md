About two years ago, when we sync purchased eBooks via Kobo for desktop app, we can get EPUB files, then we can sideload them to Sony eReader or any other device which supports Adobe Adept DRM to read.

Later Kobo changed the rules, we can only get .kepub files from Kobo for desktop app, even the files are saved in a pretty deep path. And no program can read these .kepub files except Kobo. That brings much trouble to us.

* [Convert KEPUB to ePub with Calibre Obok plugin](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Convert KEPUB to ePub and remove drm with Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Convert KEPUB to ePub and remove drm with Kobo Converter(Support Kobo Plus)](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

First things first: Before reading the following parts, please make sure you have got [Kobo for desktop](http://www.kobo.com/desktop) installed and synced the purchased eBooks.

Method 1 Convert with Calibre Obok DeDRM Plugin

### Step 1\. Install Calibre and the plugin

Go to [Calibre's official download page](http://calibre-ebook.com/download) to choose the correct version for your computer's operating system. I am going to use Calibre for Windows 7 as example, but it is also working on Mac and Linux, there won't any operating diffrecence.

This plugin is called Obok DeDRM, please click the button below to download this plugin. (Disclaim: I get this plugin from website, someone in MobileRead forum sent me the link, and the source is reliable, no malware or virus is contained.)

[Download Obok DeDRM Plugin v10.0.3](https://download.epubor.com/obok%5Fplugin.zip)

Open Calibre, click "Preferences" --> "Plugins".

![calibre preferences plguins](http://www.epubor.com/images/calibre-plugins-click.png)

As this plugin is not yet collected by Calibre's plugin library, we can only manually install it. Therefore, we need to click "Load plugin from file", and choose the obok\_plugin.zip you just downloaded from the blue button above.

![load calibre plugin from files](http://www.epubor.com/images/load-plugin-from-file.png)

Click "Yes" and "OK", keep all the options default. Once the Obok DeDRM added (under "User interface action") successfully, you will be asked to restart Calibre.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 2\. Customize Obok DeDRM plugin to convert KEPUB 

Once the plugin added OK and the Calibre restarted, you will see the Obok Plugin shown at the top menu bar. 

![obok toolbar](http://www.epubor.com/images/calibre-obok-bar.png)

Double lick the "Obok DeDRM 10.0.3", you will see an image like this.

![find kepub files](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/sync-kepub-files.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
The plugin finds the synced books automatically and display them in a list. Choose the files you want to process and click "OK". 

A small tip: You can choose multiple files by pressing "Ctrl" or "Shift" like what we do in windows file explorer.

![convert kepub to epub](http://www.epubor.com/images/convert-kepub-to-epub.png)

While the plugin converts the Kepub files to EPUB, it also removes the DRM. You can find DRM-free EPUB files in Calibre's library folder.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Now you can easily read Kobo books on any app or device supporting EPUB format, and you can also use Calibre to convert it to Mobi and read on Kindle.

Important: By default, you are able to use this plugin to convert your kepub files free. If you met problems, you can only debug the calibre and send bug reports. There is no in-time customer and technical support.

### Step 1: Install Epubor Ultimate Converter

I often used method 1 to help me resolve my problems but the result is, I still met lots of another problems. It's painful to get a messed up ePub file! So Epubor team tried best to find a better way than this for a long time. Everything comes to him who waits, now you just need to an [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) then anything resolved perfectly.

### Step 2: Sync Kobo desktop to get Kepub files

Run the Kobo desktop reading app on your computer, and then log in with your own Kobo account. By default this app will automatically help you sync your Kobo library after you get the started.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
I've said that all the files synced via Kobo desktop are with KEPUB format and are saved in a pretty deep path. But where to find them after all? What's the exactly location of Kobo KEPUB files?

**For Windows:**_C:\\Users\\(user name)\\AppData\\Local\\Kobo\\Kobo Desktop Edition\\kepub_

**For Mac:**_.../Users/(user name)/Library/Application Support/Kobo/Kobo Desktop Edition/kepub_

##### Q: I cannot find the kepub files on my mac. There is no kobo folder under Application support. Why?

Maybe your Kobo desktop is not downloaded from kobo official site, but from App store. Please ensure that your kobo for mac is from official site. This is the most important for kepub drm removing.

### Step 3: Remove DRM from Kobo KEPUB

Get Epubor Ultimate started please. **It will automatically detect your Kobo desktop including all the synced KEPUB books.**

Then grab those KEPUB books to the right area. 

Different from using Calibre plugin, with this product when books added, drm soon removed with high speed, while Calibre asks us to load a plugin first and then start removing drm.

![remove drm from kobo kepub](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/remove-drm-from-kepub.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Another good point of this tool is, Calibre Obok DeDRM plugin can only deal with DRMed Kepub books. This means, before drm removing we have to check these books had drm or not, and what's worse, for those drm free kepub files, we can't convert them to epub. But if you choose Ultimate converter you won't have these worries! It helps detect all the synced KEPUB files no matter they had drm or not.

This [in-depth guide: Kobo DRM Removal](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) also has explained this feature in detailed.

### Step 4: Convert kepub files to epub

Once drm removed, then the following step is pretty simple. Select EPUB as output format, then click on "Convert" button.

![convert kobo kepub](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-kobo-kepub.jpg)

Then the converting will start. Batch conversion supported well, just with one click.

Wait for a minute. Once finished it will pop up a window that tells you where the output ePub books are stored.![get converted epub](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/output-epub-converted-from-kepub.jpg)

Anything finished well here. Now you can open and read these converted ePub books with any ePub reader, or transfer your ePub books to iPad for reading with iBooks, and more.

Well, I only have a Kobo-reader since two days, and have been reading Kobo ePubs for a long time on other ereaders (BeBook, Boox) and on non-Kobo ereader apps on Android tablets and phone. I never ever had one kepub...

 If you have a non-Kobo ereader, or if you buy books from more stores than only Kobo, why install the Kobo desktop app?  
 If you buy books from other stores as well, or if your ereader is non-Kobo, just use the direct download links for the ePub files in your Kobo-account. Why having your Kobo-books synced to your desktop via the kobo desktop app, if you can't sync reading position etc. because you don't use a Kobo reader? And the desktop-app won't allow you to manage your books bought in other stores.

 You can read the ePubs downloaded from your Kobo account on every reader authorized with your Adobe ID, or you can first add them to your Apprentice-Alf-enhanced Calibre Library... (and if you really want, you can even sideload those epubs as kepubs to your Kobo device, if you like the extra features that this format gives you on your Kobo reader...)

There are some books that are supported only in tables or smartphones runing Android, iOS or WindowsPhone. Then downloading to a PC or Mac is not possible.  
 Digging in the smartphone, I could find the books apparently uncompressed. Instead of a single file, the book is a folder structure.  
 Any ideas of what to do with this? I already attempted to zip the file structure and change extension file to .epub. When Epubor tryes to open it, it displays an error message.

 I cannot find the kepub files on my mac. There is no ../Library/Application Support/Kobo/Kobo Desktop Edition/kepub, Kobo is not listed under Application Support at all. Help?

Everything works great, exactly as described here; including removing and reinstalling KOBO, in case a book does not get decrypted.

 Thank you!

I appreciate all your help with this, but I would have really appreciated being told the Epubor download was only the TRIAL version as it only converts 20% of the kepub BEFORE I went through the whole process.   
 Can you please make an edit to reflect that? Thanx!

I had installed the complement for Calibre and it ran well. Now I cann't see the icon in the toolbar, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it, but it still not working.

Please ensure the you are installing the right calibre drm-plugin.   
 If you really don't know how to use calibre, just try Epubor Ultimate. It is much easier to use.

Hi! I tried it with Epubor. It converted only text and only 20%. Is it because of the free version of Epubor? Will it do the job better with a paid version?  
 Thank you!

The Obot plugin is added to Calibre, but will not appear in the menu bar. I have closed and opened the program several times. It shows up in the plugins area as added but when I click on it, it says I have to 'restart the program before you can configure'
