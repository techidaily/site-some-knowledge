## Windows 10'S Latest Upgrade: Could Microsoft Copilot Be the Closing Chapter for This Operating System?

Microsoft is [ending support for Windows 10 in October 2025](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-screenflow-unleashed-the-ultimate-macos-experience/), which will [leave millions of PCs vulnerable to security exploits](https://www.spacebar.news/p/the-windows-11-problem), because many of them can't officially update to Windows 11\. Microsoft isn't changing that, but it will add its Copilot AI to Windows 10 PCs as a final farewell.

 Windows 10 has not received any significant new features in roughly three years, as Microsoft focused development on Windows 11\. The company [confirmed in April](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/secrets-of-the-pros-youtube-live-mastery-techniques-for-2024/) that Windows 10 22H2 would be the final major update, and even that final update only had a few minor changes. Built-in applications like Microsoft Edge and [Outlook](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/in-2024-30-innovative-video-themes-and-layouts/) are still receiving updates, but the underlying operating system has been in maintenance mode for a while now, with most of the updates being security fixes.

 Microsoft is dusting off Windows 10 to add a new feature, and quite possibly, the last new feature that will ever roll out to Windows 10: the Microsoft Copilot AI. It's the same pop-up panel that [arrived in Windows 11](https://www.spacebar.news/p/the-windows-11-problem) last year, giving you quick access to Microsoft's ChatGPT-based AI with a new button in the taskbar.

 Microsoft said in a blog post, "After installing today’s November 2023 non-security preview update (KB5032278), Windows Insiders in Release Preview with eligible devices running Windows 10, version 22H2 who are interested in experiencing Copilot in Windows as soon as possible when we begin rolling it out in the near future, can choose to do so by going to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and turning on ”Get the latest updates as soon as they’re available” and Check for updates. This will be a phased launch via controlled feature rollout (CFR) over the coming months."

 It's frustrating to see Microsoft adding AI features with questionable utility to Windows 10, while still not delaying the end of support or allowing more older PCs to update to Windows 11\. The company's main goal right now is rolling out AI features to as many applications and devices as possible, and because [Windows 11 adoption is stalling](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/windows-11s-adoption-continues-to-lag-windows-10s-but-its-hard-to-compare/) (partially because of the higher requirements), adding Copilot AI to Windows 10 might give another boost to Copilot usage.

 The Windows 10 update also includes bug fixes for time zones, cursor control, IE mode, the touch keyboard, and other components. Copilot won't be available for PCs with less than 4GB RAM and a screen resolution lower than 720p.
