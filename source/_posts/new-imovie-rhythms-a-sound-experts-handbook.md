You can utilize iTunes music in iMovie, but not tracks with DRM protection. You could receive a warning if the iTunes song you bought says it's protected under DRM. Even unprotected tracks stored in the cloud must be downloaded first before iMovie can use them. The same applies if you want to add Apple music to iMovie.
