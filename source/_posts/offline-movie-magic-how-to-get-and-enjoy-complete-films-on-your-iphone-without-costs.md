## Part 2\. Free Download Movies to iPhone via Movie Apps (No Computer)

A slew of free iOS movie apps are out there to let you free watch HD full movie online. See the [top free movie apps for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) like **IMDb, RedBox**, etc. But when it comes to use free movie apps to **download full movies to iPhone without computer** for offline viewing, those mentioned iPhone free movie apps are seemingly eclipsed right away. What movie download apps for iPhone can save free movies to iPhone with totally free? Here let me introduce top three apps to you.

### 1\. Free Download Movies to iPhone with Google Play Movies & TV App

Google Play Movies & TV app has the power to download free movies (MP4 1080p, 4K) to iPhone for offline enjoyment without a computer. One thing needed to be noted is that not all the features and movie resources are accessible to all countries. Different regions and areas might have different film resources and charge plans. Well, after you select the desired free movie, follow the below steps to download full movies to iPhone:

**How to Download movies to iPhone via Wi-Fi**

**Step 1.** Connect your iPhone to Wi-Fi. Make sure it strong and stable (at least 5Mbps for 1080p film and 25Mbps for 4K) to ensure fast and stable free movie downloads on iPhone.

**Step 2.** Launch Google Play Movies & TV app on your iPhone. If you have no app on your iPhone, go to Google Play App Store and get the movie app for iPhone.

**Step 3.** Tap Library and tap Downloaded Only to find downloadable movie. You will find a list of movies available for downloading on iPhone.

**Step 4.** Tap the Download button to free download movies on iPhone for offline watching on airplane via Wi-Fi (no computer).

### 2\. Download Movies to iPhone with Free Video Downloader Plus Plus

Last but not least, **Free Video Downloader Plus Plus!** is worth a try. The app is able to download movies to iPhone for offline watching, including HD full free movies, and even 4K Ultra HD movies from various sites. But it won't support movies, contents which contain the property right, such as Vimeo, Dailymotion, etc. 

And according to the users' feedback, there's an issue: If the bandwidth is too low, it'll pause the download to allow other tasks without compromise. The problem is that it often fails to re-connect with the download source, meaning that the hour you've just spent for a 5-minute video download is totally wasted and you have to go through the whole rigmarole again. So in case you plan to have a shot on free movie apps, note this drawback.

### 3\. Download Movies to iPhone with Offline Video Downloader (Discontinued)

Another one I wanna share with you is best offline video downloader, with which you are allowed to download movies from major websites and video formats and even run in background when the app is closed. Just need attention: this free app works well only with Safari brower and requires iOS 7 or later.

## Part 3\. Free Download Movies to iPhone from Movie Websites

What need reminds is, the free movies downloaded from online movie sites are always formatted in MKV, AVI, FLV, 3GP, VOB, etc. which are unfriendly with your iPhone device.
