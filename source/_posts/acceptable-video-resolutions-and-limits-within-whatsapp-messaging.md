## Part 1\. What Video Format Is Supported by WhatsApp?

WhatsApp doesn't accept all video formats. There are limits. Below is the list of WhatsApp supported video formats, together with the allowed file size. Before you send, share or play a video file via WhatsApp on iPhone, Android, Windows or Mac, check if the video makes the cut. 

**1\. WhatsApp video formats:** MP4(recommended), AVI, MKV, 3GP.

**2\. WhatsApp Video and Audio Codecs:** H.264 or MPEG-4 video codec, AAC or AC3 audio codec.

**3\. WhatsApp Maximum File Size:** 16 MB.

**4\. WhatsApp Maximum Video Length:** About 90 seconds to 3 minutes.

\* H.264 and MPEG4 cover quite a lot of formats, however, there are also many file formats not supported by WhatsApp. For example, most of the HD and 4K videos that come in H.265 HEVC or VP9 codecs are out of luck. Other videos like windows WMV, MPEG-PS, VPs are not allowed either.

\* The [WhatsApp video size limit](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) means that you can upload measly short video yet not in very high resolution. Nowadays almost all the videos are in high quality, which in turn creates large file size. A one minute HEVC video 720P HD is as large as 40MB, and the size goes up to 400MB at 4K HD @60 frames/sec, and the situation is even worse for H.264 videos. It is both a pain to share extremely short video, or highly compressed file with lost quality.

H.264 codec for video and AAC codec for audio. H.264 is a widely used video codec that provides good compression rates and reduces the file size of the video without compromising the quality. AAC is a high-quality audio codec that produces clear audio with low file size.
