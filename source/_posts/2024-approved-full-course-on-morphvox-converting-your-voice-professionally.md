## Part 1\. What is MorphVOX Junior voice changer?

[MorphVOX Junior](https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-free-voice-changer) is a free, open-source voice changer for Windows systems. This voice changer is optimized for online gaming or pranking your friends on video and voice chats on apps like Skype, Meet Now, Zoom, and more.

You only need to select it as your input microphone to use it. MorphVOX Junior will enable you to convert your voice into a man, woman, or Tiny Folks. You can also customize your voice with background sound effects like an alarm clock, screech, cuckoo, and more.

However, this voice changer is best suited for entertainment than serious-business voice changing. That's because it's pretty basic in terms of everything. For example, you only get three voices and four sound effects. Other than that, it's an excellent free voice changer to have on your computer.

## Part 2\. What is MorphVOX Pro voice changer?

If you're unsatisfied with MorphVOX Junior, purchase [MorphVOX Pro](https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-voice-changer) for $39.99 only. Unlike the Junior version, this voice changer is compatible with macOS and Windows systems. It's super easy to set up and is compatible with a range of desktop apps, including CS:GO, Skype, Discord, and more.

But the Junior version doesn't come close when it comes to voice-changing capabilities. MorphVOX Pro will change your voice into tens of active voices, including a man, woman, robot, demon, droid, child, and more. You can even download more voice effects directly on the software.

Meanwhile, you can beautify your voice further using the multi-band graphic equalizer. Also, this professional voice changer boasts effective noise reduction and voice comparison capabilities. Voice parsing detection and stereo microphone are also supported. And yes, you can record the morphed voice and morph local sound files. All in all, this voice changer is worth every penny.
