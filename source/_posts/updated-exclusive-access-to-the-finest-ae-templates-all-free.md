## How to Edit Video Title in After Effects

Once you have selected the most ideal for your video, you may wonder how you can use After Effects to edit the title and make it unique to your video project. The following is how you can edit titles in After Effects;

**_1\. Line Title Animation in After Effects_**

Use this method to add a simple animation to your video’s title. This is an ideal solution if you don’t want your title to distract from the main content;

Step1 Start by creating a new composition and then go to the crosshair icon under the preview window and select “Title/Action Safe.” This enables “Title Safe” which will add a guide to the screen to make sure your titles remain in the correct place.

![line title animation ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/line-title-animation-ae.jpg)

Step2 Click on the Text Tool and type in your title. You can use the “Character Window” on the right to change the font, size, and formatting for the video.

**_2\. Adding A Shape Around the Title_**

If you would like to add a shape around the title just to make it stand out more, use these steps;

Step1 Select the Rectangle Tool and proceed to draw a shape around the title.

![add a shape around title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-a-shape-around-title.jpg)

Step2 Under “Fill” select “None” and under “Stroke,” set to “Solid Color.”

Step3 Then go to the “Shape Layer” and click on the drop-down arrow beside “Add” to choose “Trim Paths.” You can then increase the “Start” and “Offset” as needed.

**_3\. Animating the Lines_**

If you would like to animate the lines, follow these steps;

Step1 Move the playhead to 1 second and click on the “Stopwatch” on the start icon. This will create a keyframe.

Step2 Then move the playhead back and begin to change the start value to get the desired effect.

Step3 Click on the Stopwatch icon again to create a new keyframe. Select all keyframes, right-click and go to Keyframe Assistant > Easy Ease to ensure the animation starts and stops smoothly.

**_4\. Create an Exit Animation_**

You can then close the animation loop by designing an exit animation. Here’s how to do it;

Step1 Select all the layers that you have created so far and then go to “Layers > Pre-compose.”

![create on exit animation ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-on-exit-animation-ae.jpg)

Step2 Move the playhead to about 3 seconds and then click on “Edit” and select “Split Layer.” Delete the top Split Layer.”

**_5\. Add Color to the Animation_**

Step1 Create a new composition to create new text or if you already have text on your screen, go to Window > Align and select an alignment that fits into your project.

Step2 Then click on “Effects” select “Gradient Ramp” and add the effect next to the text later.

## How to Edit Video Title in After Effects

Once you have selected the most ideal for your video, you may wonder how you can use After Effects to edit the title and make it unique to your video project. The following is how you can edit titles in After Effects;

**_1\. Line Title Animation in After Effects_**

Use this method to add a simple animation to your video’s title. This is an ideal solution if you don’t want your title to distract from the main content;

Step1 Start by creating a new composition and then go to the crosshair icon under the preview window and select “Title/Action Safe.” This enables “Title Safe” which will add a guide to the screen to make sure your titles remain in the correct place.

![line title animation ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/line-title-animation-ae.jpg)

Step2 Click on the Text Tool and type in your title. You can use the “Character Window” on the right to change the font, size, and formatting for the video.

**_2\. Adding A Shape Around the Title_**

If you would like to add a shape around the title just to make it stand out more, use these steps;

Step1 Select the Rectangle Tool and proceed to draw a shape around the title.

![add a shape around title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-a-shape-around-title.jpg)

Step2 Under “Fill” select “None” and under “Stroke,” set to “Solid Color.”

Step3 Then go to the “Shape Layer” and click on the drop-down arrow beside “Add” to choose “Trim Paths.” You can then increase the “Start” and “Offset” as needed.

**_3\. Animating the Lines_**

If you would like to animate the lines, follow these steps;

Step1 Move the playhead to 1 second and click on the “Stopwatch” on the start icon. This will create a keyframe.

Step2 Then move the playhead back and begin to change the start value to get the desired effect.

Step3 Click on the Stopwatch icon again to create a new keyframe. Select all keyframes, right-click and go to Keyframe Assistant > Easy Ease to ensure the animation starts and stops smoothly.

**_4\. Create an Exit Animation_**

You can then close the animation loop by designing an exit animation. Here’s how to do it;

Step1 Select all the layers that you have created so far and then go to “Layers > Pre-compose.”

![delete the top split layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/delete-the-top-split-layer.jpg)

Step3 Select the comp that is remaining and click on “Edit” to select “Duplicate.”

![edit duplicate ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/edit-duplicate-ae.jpg)

Step4 Right-click on the duplicated layer and choose “Time” to select “Time Reverse Layer.”

![time reverse layer ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/time-reverse-layer-ae.jpg)

Step5 Move the duplicated layers to the right until you find that there are no gaps between the two layers.

**_5\. Add Color to the Animation_**

If you would like to add color to the animation to make it stand out a little bit more, follow these steps;

Step1 Create a new composition to create new text or if you already have text on your screen, go to Window > Align and select an alignment that fits into your project.

Step2 Then click on “Effects” select “Gradient Ramp” and add the effect next to the text later.

![add color to animation ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-color-to-animation-ae.jpg)

Step3 Move the points on the screen to change the intensity and direction of the gradient as desired.

Step4 You can then use the “Effects Window” to change the color as desired.
