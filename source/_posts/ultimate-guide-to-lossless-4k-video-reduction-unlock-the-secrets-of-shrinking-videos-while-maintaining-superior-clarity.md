[4K resolution](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), also known as 4K, is one of the trendy tags sweeping over the world in recent years. At present, you can get into 4K videos in many cases, like watching 4K UHD videos on 4K TVs or monitors, recording 4K with camcorders, shooting 4K @60fps or 30fps on iPhone, streaming high definition 4K video from YouTube, Netflix and more. It of course brings you an ultimate visual experience compared with HD videos, whereas its huge size of 4K video stops you from playing, uploading, editing and storing 4K video unless you compress 4K videos.

## Why You Compress 4K UHD Videos?

The first comes to video file size. A minute of 4K at 60fps is approximately 400MB, while only 90MB is taken for a minute of 1080p at 60fps. Thus if you're a 4K video fan, it's easy to run out of the storage space especially for lower 64GB iPhone or limited free iCloud storage. 

Yet another is the compatibility issue. Though you're able to [watch 4K UHD videos on 4K media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), TVs, or monitors, there are more devices that are not compatible with 4K resolution like iPhone iPad Android devices, Macbook Pro/Air, and Windows PCs. Not to mention sometimes you cannot import 4K to iMovie for editing or fail to upload 4K video YouTube or the like. Thus, you do need process and compress 4K ultras HD videos.

However, when you're trying to shrink 4K videos, you'll find the common [4K video processing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) perform fairly slow, and worse still, the shrinked 4K UHD video looks much blurry and even pixilated. So to get out of the trouble, a more impressive 4K video compressor is essential to reduce 4K video size without losing quality at fast speed. While some one would say compression is not possible without quality loss. Yes, but not exactly. Before 4K video compression, it's best to know the terms of lossy and lossless compression. 

![Lossy vs lossless compression](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/article-image/4k-video-compressor-2.jpg) 

**Lossless Compression.** When a file that has been compressed can be decoded back into its original form with zero loss of information, the compression can be Lossless. Actually, it's almost a pipe dream unless vector images are scaled based on pure mathematical principles, or an algorithm that stores duplicate pixel data in some place can replace them just as easily. 

**Lossy Compression.** If, after compression, the original file cannot be brought back again, then that would be Lossy. Generally, all the video compression we've mentioned is lossy since the codec is lossy as such.

**Visually Lossless Compression.** Lossy compression that produces negligible differences may be called visually lossless. And the aim of every algorithm is to achieve a visually lossless look. Usually what we're talking about shrinking video without losing quality means visually lossless compression indeed.

Speaking of a tool to reduce 4K video file size, [**MacX Video Converter Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is undoubtedly the best [4K video compression software on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), which doesn't process 4K videos as slow as Handbrake, and has no 4K video not importing or exporting issue occurred on iMovie and Final Cut Pro.

1. Convert 4K video to any formats/codecs, like converting 4K to MP4, AVI, FLV and 200 more formats, transcoding 4K H264 to HEVC, VP9.
2. Adjust video parameters like compressing 4K to 1080p/720p or SD resolution, decreasing the bitrate at 20-50%, lowering frame rate from 4K 60fps to 30fps, or changing 4:3 aspect ratio to 16:9 etc.

While to shrink 4K video to the hilt, select **General Profiles > HEVC Video > Done**, which will reduce 4K file size up to 50% without losing quality.

**Bitrate** can be reduced by 20-50% of the original one. In this case, your videos will shrink considerably in size without noticeable changes by naked eyes.

 Change the 4:3 **aspect ratio** to 16:9 will reduce the video size to some extent, even though not so much obviously.

 Click on **Edit** button on main interface, then **Trim > Enable Trimming** to trim the length of video or Crop & Expand > Enable Crop to adjust the position and size of the video image. This helps a lot to [compress 4K video for email](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) or Whatsapp, messagers etc.
