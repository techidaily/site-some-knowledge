Hdri-Skies is a premium website focusing on outdoors and open sky HDRI. It offers a magnificent collection of images differentiated in terms of time and location. It can be intimidating to choose a sky map from such a vast collection; therefore, the website offers filters to choose an HDRI from a specific moment of the day.

**Our Verdict**

HDR maps also offer numerous other HDRI with time lapses and multiple textures. However, these images might make a dent in your wallet. HDR maps are free of any ads, making it easier to find the image you want, test it out and see if it is what you are looking for.
