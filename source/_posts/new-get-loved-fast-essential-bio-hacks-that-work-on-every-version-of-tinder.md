## Part 3\. Make Him or Her Swipe Right: Create Attractive Profiles

Tinder bio is a small blank space that takes a minute to fill but content matters. While guys most probably swipe over the top to bottom without noting down the Tinder profile description, girls are selective in choosing the perfect match before swipe right.

### 1\. Use Tinder Loop

Tinder introduced a Tinder loop, a video feature that increases the chances of getting swiped right. With this attribute, you can capture favorite activities like cliff jumping, and shooting hoops, showcase them to your **Tinder profile**.

As you can import videos from the iOS camera roll, you can create or customize videos using [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software like [Filmora from Wondershare](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and add cool effects, transitions, overlays, reversed videos, etc.

**Tip**: Adding a little humor to your Tinder profile goes well when mixed up with genuine personal interest. You can showcase a few attractions like sports, traveling, a hobby that can help find a perfect match who can have similar interests.

## Part 3\. Make Him or Her Swipe Right: Create Attractive Profiles

Tinder bio is a small blank space that takes a minute to fill but content matters. While guys most probably swipe over the top to bottom without noting down the Tinder profile description, girls are selective in choosing the perfect match before swipe right.

So, here are some tips for creating a better attractive Tinder profile.

### 1\. Use Tinder Loop

Tinder introduced a Tinder loop, a video feature that increases the chances of getting swiped right. With this attribute, you can capture favorite activities like cliff jumping, and shooting hoops, showcase them to your **Tinder profile**.

As you can import videos from the iOS camera roll, you can create or customize videos using [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software like [Filmora from Wondershare](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and add cool effects, transitions, overlays, reversed videos, etc.

### 5\. Be real and honest

Even though tinder is just an online dating app, it doesn’t mean that you should be unreal or dishonest. You can be casual as it is getting around with new people, and hence you need to be clear in whom you are, what you like, and what you need.
