![note icon](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../image-style/new-seo/icon0.png)

Some reddit users reported that Fosshub compromised with malware. So be careful when downloading it on Mac.

## Part 2: Tutorial: How to Use MKVToolNix for Mac to Remux MKV 

Remuxing refers to a lossless process of changing the format from one another, e.g. from [MP4 to MKV](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), [AVI to MKV](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), etc without something such as audios or subtitles one doesn't want, thus reducing the file size and saving space. Just follow the steps below and learn how to remux files to MKV. 

1. Open the MKVToolNix-17.0.0.app on Mac.
2. Find and add the file you want to edit.
3. Select and edit tracks accordingly.

* Language: You can select the language for each track.
* Default track: It tells the player that a specific track should be preferred upon playback.
* Video properties: You can go to Video properties to set aspect ratio, e.g. change from 4:3 to 16:9\.
