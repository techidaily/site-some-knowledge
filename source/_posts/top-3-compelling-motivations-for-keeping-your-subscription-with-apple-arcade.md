## Top 3 Compelling Motivations for Keeping Your Subscription with Apple Arcade

### Key Takeaways

* Apple Arcade offers thoughtful and well-designed mobile ports that perform well on iOS devices like iPhone and iPad, Mac and Apple TV.
* The subscription provides an ad-free gaming experience with no in-app purchases for a reasonable price of $6.99 per month.
* Excellent controller and accessory support enhance gameplay, with options like the Backbone One and Apple Pencil for precision and comfort.

 Apple Arcade is a gaming subscription aimed at iPhone owners, which also works on iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Despite some recent subscription cost increases, I don't see myself canceling my Apple Arcade subscription anytime soon.

##  Game Performance and Design

 I have spent years perusing the [massive Apple Arcade library](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-photos-from-android-gallery-app-on-c51-by-stellar-photo-recovery-android-mobile-photo-recover/), and trying out my fair share of games. One of the first things I noticed when using Apple Arcade for the first time was how seamlessly and elegantly every game performs.

 It is clear to me that Apple put a lot of effort into carefully curating its game library, as everything I've played feels perfectly at home on my iPhone and iPad. Games created specifically for iOS like _[Japanese Rural Life Adventure](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/japanese-rural-life-adventure/id1634749545)_ and _[Sneaky Sasquatch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sneaky-sasquatch/id1098342019)_ showcase thoughtfully considered UI elements, controls, and graphics that truly make the games feel at home on Apple peripherals.

 Even games ported from other platforms have been modified to play beautifully and comfortably. Games like _[Slay the Spire](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slay-the-spire/id6448808007&ved=2ahUKEwiqzNnx2ZCHAxVkm4kEHUtuCfUQFnoECBQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1vNKqufMrwQfyig0YpIhdK)_[_+_](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slay-the-spire/id6448808007) and _[The Oregon Trail](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-oregon-trail/id1502228492)_ function seamlessly with touch screen controls, and it is clear Apple has overseen the effort to adapt and port games to play as well as possible on Apple Arcade.

##  Apple Arcade Has No Ads or In-App Purchases

 When I find a mobile game I really like, I am often tempted to purchase the ad-free experience. With mobile ads becoming more prevalent and obnoxious, they tend to completely ruin the experience of many games. For some games, I'm happy to pay $5 or so to get rid of advertisements permanently.

 Most recently, however, ad removal comes in the form of a subscription, and I've seen some costing up to $10 a week. With the cheapest Hulu plan costing around $8 a month, I find paying $40 a month total to remove ads impossible to justify.

Apple

 Apple Arcade offers an ad-free experience that's also devoid of in-app purchases for a relatively low price. Instead of paying separate weekly subscriptions to avoid ads on individual games, an Apple Arcade subscription allows me to play over 200 games for a single monthly charge of $6.99 ([up from $4.99 last year](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/guarding-authenticity-openais-anti-cheat-for-gpt-text-generation/)).

 The quality of games on offer is a huge bonus. I can't imagine having to deal with constant advertising and pay-to-win mechanics on all of my mobile games again.

##  Excellent Controller and Accessory Support

 Though Apple Arcade has done a great job making its game library playable with only touch controls, playing with a controller can still be more comfortable for some players. Luckily, many Apple Arcade titles feature excellent controller support.

 My favorite controller for mobile gaming is the [Backbone One](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-or-bypass-knox-enrollment-service-on-oppo-find-x7-ultra-by-drfone-android/), as it telescopically expands to fit your iPhone between the controls, offering a classic handheld gaming experience. These games can also be played with most Bluetooth controllers, which is great for players using a larger device. Many excellent games like _[Crashlands+](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crashlands/id1582683689)_ and _[Stardew Valley+](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stardew-valley/id6449264810)_ have great controller support, bringing a new level of benefit to the Apple Arcade subscription.

 Another unexpected accessory that elevates the Apple Arcade experience is the Apple Pencil. Because many of these games are designed around touch inputs, they can often require precise and quick taps.

 The Apple Pencil is a great input device to replace traditional tapping and dragging, and allows you to play several games in a whole new way. Games like _[Cityscapes: Sim Builder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cityscapes-sim-builder/id1631153096)_ and _[Mini Motorways](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mini-motorways/id1453901000)_ bring out the best of the Apple Pencil, taking full advantage of its high precision and responsiveness.

 I haven't had any regrets since purchasing Apple Arcade. It has made mobile gaming a much more pleasant experience, and my go-to when I have some time to kill or want to play games away from home. It's put a bit of magic back into the mobile gaming experience, which has deteriorated significantly over the years.

 It is something to consider for those who play games on Apple devices, and I don't see myself canceling my subscription any time soon. If you have [an all-inclusive Apple One subscription](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-10-visionary-beauty-experts-leading-online-trends-for-2024/), you already have Apple Arcade.
