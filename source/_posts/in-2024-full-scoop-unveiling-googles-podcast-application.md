## Part 5: How to record your podcast show for Google Podcast App

Now that you know **what the Google Podcast app is,** you can also use it to post your show content. However, one cannot use this app to create new shows; one can only add the RSS feed of the show's URL to the platform.

Instead, you can try out [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create and record podcast episodes. It allows users to record their voiceover and edit the content, after which directly posting the content is simple. Also, you can transcribe the language you are using with the Speech-to-text feature on Filmora and add it to the accompanying video for foreign listeners.
