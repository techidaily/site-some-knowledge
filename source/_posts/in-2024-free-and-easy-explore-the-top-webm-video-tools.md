The demand for online video has been increasing steadily over the course of the last ten years and this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. The format in which a video file is saved often determines its quality and size, but as the file’s size decreases so does its quality.

That is the reason why Google developed the WebM file format that preserves a video’s quality while minimizing its size. Even though it has been nearly ten years since the WebM file format was first introduced it is still relatively difficult to find a media player that can play this type of video file. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to play WebM video files and introduce you to six free media players you can use to play WebM videos on Mac and PC computers.

## How to Play WebM Video Files on Windows and macOS without a Media Player?

WebM file format is commonly used for videos that are uploaded to the Internet, as they are relatively small in size and capable of delivering excellent image quality. For instance, YouTube videos in resolutions that vary from 360p to 4K are all saved in the WebM file format. In addition, web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge can all play WebM video files without the help of third-party media players.

In order to play a video saved in the WebM format from the Safari web browser, you must either install the [VLC web browser plugin for macOS X](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html). What’s more, you must make sure that the web browser you’re using to open a WebM video is updated, since older versions of Google Chrome, Opera or Mozilla Firefox cannot open the videos saved in this file format.

Note: If you want to edit the recorded WebM video files, you can check these [best free WebM video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## How to Play WebM files on iOS and Android Operating Systems

WebM videos can be played on all Android devices that have Android 2.3 Gingerbread or later version of the OS, without installing a third-party media player. This means that you can watch the WebM videos that are stored locally or on the Internet directly from your phone. However, iPhone owners cannot watch WebM videos before they install an app that allows them to open a video saved in the WebM format.

Installing the [PlayerXtreme Media Player](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playerxtreme-media-player/id456584471) will solve this issue, as the app that supports file formats like 3gp, MKV, ISO, or WebM among numerous others. The app supports playback of audio and video files in HD resolution and allows you to download subtitles for free in just a few easy taps.

Saving videos from devices that are connected to the same network, accessing WebM and all other types of video files via a web browser or casting videos on large screens with Google Cast or AirPlay are also among the options you will have at your disposal if you install PlayerXtreme Media Player on your iPhone. Even though this app can be downloaded for free, opting for a monthly subscription or upgrading to the pro version of the app may be a good idea if you want to use it on a daily basis.

**Conclusion**

WebM video file format is still widely regarded as the file format for Internet videos. Even so finding a media player that will enable you to watch WebM videos from a Smartphone, Mac or PC computer shouldn’t be too hard since VLC player is already one of the most commonly used media players in the world. Which media player are you using to play WebM videos? Leave a comment and let us know.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The demand for online video has been increasing steadily over the course of the last ten years and this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. The format in which a video file is saved often determines its quality and size, but as the file’s size decreases so does its quality.

That is the reason why Google developed the WebM file format that preserves a video’s quality while minimizing its size. Even though it has been nearly ten years since the WebM file format was first introduced it is still relatively difficult to find a media player that can play this type of video file. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to play WebM video files and introduce you to six free media players you can use to play WebM videos on Mac and PC computers.

## How to Play WebM Video Files on Windows and macOS without a Media Player?

WebM file format is commonly used for videos that are uploaded to the Internet, as they are relatively small in size and capable of delivering excellent image quality. For instance, YouTube videos in resolutions that vary from 360p to 4K are all saved in the WebM file format. In addition, web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge can all play WebM video files without the help of third-party media players.

In order to play a video saved in the WebM format from the Safari web browser, you must either install the [VLC web browser plugin for macOS X](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html). What’s more, you must make sure that the web browser you’re using to open a WebM video is updated, since older versions of Google Chrome, Opera or Mozilla Firefox cannot open the videos saved in this file format.

Note: If you want to edit the recorded WebM video files, you can check these [best free WebM video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## The Six Best Free WebM Media Players macOS and Windows 10

Besides viewing WebM videos through a web browser you can also use Mac and PC-based media players to watch WebM videos. However, finding a free media player that allows you to open a WebM video doesn’t have to be difficult, despite the fact that this video file format isn’t supported by all media players. So, let’s take a look at the six best WebM media player for macOS and Windows 10.

### 1\. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

After you launch VLC, you just have to select the Open File option from the Media menu and then navigate to the location on your hard drive at which the WebM video you want to play is saved. Click on the file to select it and proceed to click on the Open button. Optionally you can just drag the WebM video from the folder, drop it in VLC and it will start playing automatically.
