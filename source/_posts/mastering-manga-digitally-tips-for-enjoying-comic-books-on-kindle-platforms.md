Kindle has become a versatile platform for book lovers, and manga enthusiasts are no exception. With its crisp display and user-friendly interface, the Kindle is an excellent device for reading manga. In this article, we'll delve into the steps and tips to help you seamlessly enjoy managa on Kindle devices.

* [Part 1\. Read Purchased Amazon Manga on Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Part 2\. Read Downloaded Manga on Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Part 1: Read Purchased Amazon Manga on Kindle

The easiest way is to purchase the manga from Amazon store. There are thousands of manga covering a broad range of taste. Marvel comics, Manga books and collections are all available for your choice. 

![Amazon](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Amazon315.png)

Browsing the amazon store on your computer or just through your Kindle device, you can buy any manga you like. Once the manga has been purchased, it will be ready to download. What you have to do is to download it and read it. 

As other Amazon eBooks, the manga books purchased from Amazon.com are protected by Kindle DRM, so you can not back up these books or share them with your friends or families. Here I recommend the **best Kindle DRM Removal**\--[Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) to you. With it, you can easily [_Remove DRM from Kindle & ComiXology Books_](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) and convert Kindle to PDF/EPUB/mobi/AZW3.

#### Pro Tips Can I read Comixology manga on Kindle? 

Yes, you can read Comixology manga on Kindle devices. And here is how to guide.

**Note:** As part of merging with Kindle, all books purchased previously on Comixology are now visible on your Kindle devices and apps (excluding Kindle e-Reader devices) in your library.

**Step 1:** If you have always used an Amazon account to login to Comixology, you do not need to merge your account. Otherwise, you need to [Connect your account](https://www.amazon.com/comixology/account/merge).

**Step 2:** All your purchased Comixology comics will be in your Kindle library. If your Comixology comics has not been synced, go to "[Contents & Devices](https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/digital-console/contentlist/booksAll/dateDsc/)" of Amazon, select the book you want read, click "Deliver or Remove from device", then select your target Kindle, and delive this Comixology comics to it.

### Part 2: Read Downloaded Manga on Kindle

However, for real manga fans, purchasing from Amazon site can not fulfill their dedications to comics. They are looking for every chance to download the most popular manga from various sites. Why? Because they can get [**high-quality free manga from online free manga websites**](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) which can not only save their money but also allow they to read the updated manga.

Manga is basically pictures, not text. The downloaded manga is mostly in the format of JPEG/PNG/CBR/CBZ/PDF which is not supported by Kindle device. When the first time I tried to read Manga on my Kindle, I had no clue but just copied these kinds of files to it. They totally drived me crazy, and I even gave up. However, I can not pursuade myself to abandon manga and Kindle. So I am here to share these easy and good methods about reading manga on Kindle with you guys.

#### Method 1: Calibre 

I would like to recommend Calibre. This is a must-be tool for every e-reader user. 

Supported system: 

![Calire](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Calibre315-1.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 1: [Download](https://calibre-ebook.com/download) and Install it.

Step 2: Convert downloaded file to Mobi format

Add your renamed Zip or RAR manga to Calibre. If there are more than one files, you can add them to the Calibre at one time. Then right click the book to choose to “Convert Individually” or “Bulk Convert”. Choose “Mobi” as the output format, and click “OK” to finish the conversion.

Step 3: Read Manga on Kindle

Then use the USB cable to connect your Kindle to PC. Copy the converted file to Documents folder of your Kindle device. Eject your Kindle device from your computer, you will find the converted mobi manga on your Kindle. Just click the book title to open it.

EmEditor is a fast, lightweight, yet extensible, easy-to-use text editor, code editor, CSV editor, and large file viewer for Windows. Both native 64-bit and 32-bit builds are available, and moreover, the 64-bit includes separate builds for SSE2 (128-bit), AVX-2 (256-bit), and AVX-512 (512-bit) instruction sets.

You can see the manga displays very well on my old Kindle Keyboard. I have to admit there are also some downsides, like image color is black and white. Anyway, Calibre was not designed to convert images, but to convert normal ebooks.

#### Method 2: Kindle Comic Converter

Kindle Comic Converter is designed to transform your PNG, JPG, GIF, CBZ, CBR and CB7 files into EPUB or MOBI format e-books. With it, reading comics and manga on your E-Ink Kindle is much easier.

Supported system: Windows, Linux, OSX

[Download here](https://kcc.iosphe.re/). Before installation, you have to download [KindleGen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211). Once the KindleGen has been download, you have to unzip it and add it to the Kindle Comic Converter’s directory.

Double click the KKC icon at the desktop to open it. Click "Add file" button to put the download file into this software. Then choose the target device, including Kindle and Kobo series products. There are also other options for your choice, such as Manga mode, webtoon mode, Spread splitter and so on. You can select these options according to your device and your reading custom. Please select "MOBI" as ?the output format for your manga and click "Convert" to finish the converting process.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 3: Reading Manga on Kindle

The converted manga will be in the same folder as the original file, but in Mobi format. Please just cope it to the “documents” folder of your Kindle device. It displays very well on my Kindle.

Now, you can read the latest manga on your Kindle, no matter it is Kindle Keyboard or Kindle PaperWhite. Although there are some drawbacks of reading manga on Kindle, such as manga color is only black and white, many people still choose to read manga on Kindle. Let's say they they make a good decision because Kindle have long battery life and will not hurt their eyes.
