Although epub is one of the most common ebook formats, pdf is supported by more devices or readers. So here I will share with you how to convert epub to pdf with Calibre. Calibre is always quoted as an [free epub to pdf converter.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) If you have a lot of epub files but you cannot read them on various readers or certain devices such as kindle that don't support epub but pdf. It would be a pity. So why not convert epub to pdf to make the full use of your epub books?

2 Run Calibre and add the books to it.

Open Calibre, click the "Add books" button at the top left corner to add epub books that need to be converted to pdf. When you succeed in adding books, the title of the ebooks will be displayed in the main interface.

3 Select your epub books that you want to convert to pdf and then click the "Convert books" button.

Choose PDF as the output format in the pop-up window and click the "OK" button.

### Part 2\. Convert DRM EPUB to PDF with Calibre

As you can see, it's very easy to convert DRM free EPUB to PDF with Calibre. Now let's take a look at how to convert DRM protected epub files to pdf with Calibre. The DRMed epub files need you to take more effort to deal with it.

If the epub books come with drm, they have to be decrypted before converting formats. Usually, a warning message will pop up if the file has drm.

![drmed book](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/drmed-book.jpg)

Then what to do? If you want to remove epub drm using Calibre, you have to download the DeDRM Plugins to your computer and then add it to Calibre. Below are the step by step guide.

**Step 1.** Download and install [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download) to your computer.

**Step 2.** Download [Calibre DeDRM Plugins](http://www.epubor.com/<a href=) to your computer.

**Step 3.** Add the DeDRM plugins to Calibre.

Run Calibre, navigate to "Preferences" on the top of Calibre's interface.

![preferences option](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/calibre-preferences-option.jpg)

Click "Preferences">>>"Plugin".

![choose plugin](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/choose-calibre-plugin.jpg)

Then click "Load plugin from file" button in the pop-up window and select your already downloaded Calibre plugin file "DeDRM\_plugin.zip" to it. 

![load plugin from file](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/load-plugin.jpg)

Then it will come up a window asks if you are sure to proceed to install the plugins, just click the "Yes" icon to continue.

![click yes](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/click-yes.png)

There will be a noticing window to tell you that the plugins installation has succeeded in Calibre. Click "OK" icon to finish.

#### Step 4\. Remove epub drm.

Now restart Calibre and add your DRMed books to it. Usually it will remove the books' DRM automatically. If your DRMed books are already in your Calibre library, you should remove them from Calibre first and then re-add them to Calibre, or their DRM will not be removed.

**Note:** Not all adobe drm can be removed with Calibre, for example, right now Calibre can no longer remove Nook DRM any more. so don't be panic if you fail to decrypt epub files, after all, it's a freeware. By the way, if you want to decrypt Kindle books with Calibre, you can read this step by step guide about [how to remove KFX DRM with Calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/); and if you want to decrypt Kobo/Google Play books, you can read this guide about [how to remove DRM from Kobo/Google Play Book](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

#### Step 5\. Convert to pdf.

Now you get the drm-free epub files. Then you can follow part guide to [convert these drm-free epub files to pdf with Calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

You can see that this whole process is rather complicated and time-consuming. And you may meet problems like the program exits unexpectedly or fail to remove drm at times. The point I want to stress is that it's not a good choice to use Calibre remove ebook drm, at least not the perfect choice.

Anyway, Calibre is good for managing ebooks and convert formats but not a good drm removal. If you are looking for a powerful program that can solve all problems better, I strongly recommend [Epubor Ultimate Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) to you, which can remove Kindle/kobo/google play drm effortlessly as well as convert ebooks formats easily.

By defaul epubor ultimate tool (calibre too) won't help you edit the converted PDF files. It only helps remove DRM and convert eBooks formats between Kindle, ePub and PDF.
