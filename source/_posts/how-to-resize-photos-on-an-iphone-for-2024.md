### Method 1: Resizing photos via Email

 This process may not be the fastest way imaginable to change the size of your images, but it still effective.

 Simply select the pictures you want to resize in the Photos app and click share, or if you have an iPhone 7 click on the Action icon.

 Despite being relatively easy, this method of resizing images doesn't allow you to enter the new size of a photo manually which may limit your options.

### Method 2: Using apps to resize your photos

 Even though apps for iPhones that allow you to resize your photos require you to spend some money, this method is still much more effective than resizing images via email.

#### 1\. [Image Size](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/image-size/id670766542?mt=8)

 iPhone photographers can resize their photos in three simple steps with this app. The Image Size app is free to download but if you want to get rid of the adds you must pay $3,99\. However, all you need to do to change the size of an image with this app is to open the photo you want to resize and select the output size. Removing the parts of the image is made possible by the Cropping tool so you can even decide which parts of the photo you want to remove. Once you've completed the process of resizing the picture you can choose whether you want to Save, Send or Share your photo.

#### 2\. [PhotoShrinker](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photoshrinker/id928350374?mt=8)

PhotoShrinker automatically compresses the photo to one-tenth of its original size, which means that you can free up a lot of space if you choose to invest $3,99 in this app. The latest version of the app also enables you to delete photos you don't like, but its users shouldn't count on it for any other kind of photo editing activity.

#### 3\. [Reduce](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reduce-batch-resize-images-and-photos-for-iphone-ipad/id580474806?mt=8)

Furthermore, the app lets you add a border to your photos in order to separate it from the background.

### Conclusion

 Preserving the quality of your photos is important and for that reason, you should only use methods of resizing photos on your iPhone that allow you to produce good images, regardless of their size. Using apps to resize photos may cost you some money, but it will provide you with powerful tools that will allow you to have control over the photo resizing process.
