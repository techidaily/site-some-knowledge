[How to download Kindle book from Kindle Cloud Reader?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/31/2020 7:49:52 PM 

My Kindle book does not download from Kindle Cloud Reader if I click on the book cover.

[What is the work around for Kindle's latest updated version](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/26/2023 10:25:45 AM 

Amazon requires latest updated version 1.39.2.65383 to be able to download Kindle books to my PC. Epubar gives an error and has prompt to auto-downgrade to version 1.32 because of their inability to crack the code in later versions. I tried this and this work around does not work as Kindle will no longer allow downloads of books in the 1.32 version and requires the update to the 1.39.2.65383 version to be able to do this. As such, what fix/ work around do you have to remedy this issue? 

[Epubor KCR not working with Kindle Cloud Reader](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/reader/) \-- 8/2/2020 2:26:30 AM 

I can't get Epubor KCR to work with Kindle Cloud Reader now. It looks like Amazon removed the ability to download kindle books. There is no button for downloads and nothing happens when I right-click the book cover in Kindle Cloud Reader. When I open a book, it doesn't download because epubor KCR doesn't see any books. Can this be made to work? Epubor KCR only works with Kindle Cloud Reader. I am using Chrome.

[Lost Kindle Oasis](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 8/10/2023 6:38:14 AM 

I have lost my Kindle Oasis.  
 But I still have the Serial Number saved as a .txt file.  
 I am using Epobor Ultimate on Windows 11.  
 That Kindle serial number is in the "Settings" on Epubor Ultimate.  
 How can I download Kindle books via USB and load them into Epubor Ultimate ?  
 Be aware I am 93 and the light bulb is getting a bit dim.  
 Thanks for any help.

The epub kindle converter for macOS was a total fiasco. After being able to download Kindle books on the Android emulator, I refreshed the Epubor kindle converter with opened kindle and nothing happened. It can't find the book directory on the kindle application support directory and there's no way to point to that directory.
