Above we have listed several online tools that can work directly from a browser. Though simple and free to use, these programs are internet-dependent and have file size restrictions, and other limitations. So, if you are looking for a full-fledged Windows or Mac-based software that can convert JPG to GIF in high quality, we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best tool for a long run.

Though Wondershare Filmora is an advanced and professional video editing software, it supports multiple additional features including JPG to GIF conversion. The JPG as well as other image files on your system can be converted to GIF files using the export function of the software. In just a few clicks, your desired animated files along with editing if required are ready.
