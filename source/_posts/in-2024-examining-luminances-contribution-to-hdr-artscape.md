1. HDR Processing

Luminance HDR separates the processing of HDR images into two phases: The creation of HDR images and its conversion to an LDR image.

So, in all, we could say the Luminance HDR processing is reliable.

1. UI and Layout

The Luminous HDR interface is fairly responsive, but some of the features are quite confusing, making it challenging. Users can set a preferred interface theme and set it if they want it to always show in the preview panel window.
