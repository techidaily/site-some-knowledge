## From Laggard to Lightning: Pick 8 Apps Now

In video playback, how the content plays out and the playback's speed determines content quality. Many editors add slow-motion effects to videos or parts to create a stylish and top-notch look.

It can get annoying to deal with when you are trying to play a video, but it starts automatically playing in slow-motion on your video player.
