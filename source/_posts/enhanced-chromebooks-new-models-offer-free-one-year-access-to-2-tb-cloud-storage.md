## Enhanced Chromebooks: New Models Offer Free One-Year Access to 2 TB Cloud Storage

Chromebook Plus laptops just gained a collection of exclusive AI-powered features, including a right-click shortcut for Gemini text generation. More interestingly, Google is now offering a free year of its 2TB cloud storage plan with all Chromebook Plus purchasesâ€”that's a $240 value.

 Late last year, Google introduced the [Chromebook Plus program](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-high-precision-display-unveiled-hp-dreamcolor-z32x/) for customers who want a more substantial Chrome OS experience. Chromebook Plus laptops, such as the new [Acer Spin 714](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/exclusive-roundup-best-windows-11-video-recording-options-for-2024/), fit a certain set of hardware specifications that ensure a long-lasting, future-proof experience.

 Of course, these laptops are more powerful than the typical Chromebook. So, Google is using the Chromebook Plus platform as a testing ground for Gemini AI integration. There are three new AI-powered features for Chromebook Plus, and Google is offering a year of its [Google One AI Premium plan](https://one.google.com/about/plans?g1%5Flanding%5Fpage=0) to all new Chromebook Plus customers. This plan, which normally costs $20 a month, provides access to Gemini Advance and 2TB of cloud storage.

* **Gemini Chatbot Integration:** Chromebook Plus users can now chat with Gemini from their desktop. You'll find a handy Gemini shortcut in the app shelf on your home screen.
* **Help Me Write:** Right-click in any text field to generate writing on the fly. You can also use Help Me Write to fill out PDF fields or rewrite existing text.
* **Generative AI Wallpapers:** Build AI wallpapers using prompts or Google's presets. You can also generate custom video chat backgrounds.
* **Magic Editor in Google Photos:** Use AI to retouch or edit images in Google Photos, just as you would on a Pixel smartphone.

 Google is also introducing the ability to create GIFs with Chrome OS' built-in screen recorder. Plus, you can now set up a new Chromebook using nothing more than your Android phone. These two improvements are available for all Chromebooks, not just Plus models.

 The Chrome OS platform will gain some more improvements later this year, including Gemini summarization for web articles and PDFs, an automated Focus mode, and a "Pick up where you left off" function that recovers your windows, tabs, and apps. [Project Gameface](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-project-gameface/), an AI-powered accessibility tool that lets you control a Chromebook using facial gestures, is also in the works.

 Chromebook Plus laptops start at $350 and are readily available at retailers like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=chromebook+plus&i=electronics&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003363&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fchromebook-plus-laptops-come-with-2tb-cloud-storage%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) or [Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle%2Fchromebook-plus%2Fpcmcat1692981518684.c). I'd like to reiterate that new Chromebook Plus laptops come with two years of the Google 2TB cloud storage plan. It's a stupidly good deal, especially if you're already paying for 2TB of Google cloud storage.
