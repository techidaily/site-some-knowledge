## Part 2 Crop Music You Added On Canva

When it comes to video or audio editing, the biggest thing is trimming. Trimming helps to reduce the content length or time duration by which you can share the video with appropriate time limits. With the following procedure, you can easily edit the audio file.

## Part 3 Edit Your Music On Canva

**Step 1: Open My Media**

In the navigation system or side panel, you can find out MY MEDIA section. It will help you get access to the available media files that are linked to your Canva account.

**Step 2: Gray Pencil**

Now, you should proceed by choosing the GRAY PENCIL ICON. You can find out this icon with the video. Generally, it is considered as an edit symbol that will allow you to access the complete edit panel without any problem.

**Step 3: Launch Editor And Edit**

You should click the edit icon and launch the respective interface. In case you want to trim the audio, you can use left and right brackets and drag them to the positions. The left bracket will help you decide the starting point and the right one help you pick the ending point. By using both, you can pick a section that you want to add to the video.

If you like to chop the audio, you should choose the section by using the scissors icon. The selected audio section will be removed and the remaining can be added to the video. As for the editor features, you can also apply fades to the audio. It will help you to mix different audios or create some low moments in the video.

**Step 4: Preview**

After making all these edits on video and audio, you should merge both files. Before proceeding to the final step, it will be good if you consider a preview. Preview will help you understand the video is created perfectly or not. In case there’s any kind of issue with the video, you will get it during preview and fix it immediately.

**Step 5: Save & Download**

In case you are satisfied with the preview results, you should click the SAVE or SAVE A COPY button. You can also download the file to get it on your device and share it on other platforms.

It is the complete procedure that will help you to edit an audio file on Canva with ease.
