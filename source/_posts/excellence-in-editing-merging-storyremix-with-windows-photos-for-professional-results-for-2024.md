**Note**: S is for mobile and email with a small video, M is for social media uploads, and L is meant for large Remix videos meant for large screens.

The file location is displayed soon after you create the video by the Photos app. On wanting to share the video, just hit on ‘Share to social media, email, or other apps’.

Now, pick the app or contact and send the video.

Recent videos are found on ‘Collections’ section if they are auto created. Otherwise, all the Story Remix files are located permanently on ‘Creations’ section.
