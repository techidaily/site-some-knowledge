## Say Goodbye to Wi-Fi Woes: How Windows 11 Solves Common Connectivity Issues

One of the more annoying aspects of Windows 11 is looking for a Wi-Fi network and then fiddling with the operating system to show you a complete list of options. Thankfully, a future update will finally add a Wi-Fi refresh button to Windows 11.

 This certainly isn't a new issue, as there have been [complaints for years](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/zjeegz/how%5Fthe%5Fhell%5Fdo%5Fyou%5Frefresh%5Fthe%5Fwifi%5Fnetwork%5Flist/) about the lack of a way to refresh the Wi-Fi selection. In the latest Windows 11 Canary build from earlier this week, Microsoft is officially testing a Wi-Fi refresh button near the bottom of the screen. That way, instead of constantly opening and closing the network list, hoping for a refreshed list, you can easily click a button and find the network you're looking for.

 The new feature was [first spotted on X](https://twitter.com/PhantomOfEarth/status/1724853690169802848) (formerly Twitter) and then [confirmed](https://twitter.com/brandonleblanc/status/1724857968720777286) by a Windows Senior Program Manager. Apparently, this new addition isn't mentioned in the release notes because it's "not quite working" with everything, and the developer team is still making changes and improving the system. Either way, diagnosing Wi-Fi issues or hunting for networks is about to get a lot easier.

 Remember that this helpful feature is only now appearing in Canary builds for Windows 11, meaning it could be a while before all the kinks get worked out, and it arrives for everyone. Either way, this is a good sign that Microsoft is actively listening to feedback and at least has a fix in the works.

 Getting a Wi-Fi refresh button is certainly a step in the right direction, but that's just one of many potential issues with finding and interacting with networks. In the meantime, you can check out our guide on [how to fix common Windows 11 Wi-Fi issues](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-flawless-pixel-processor-windowsmac/), including resetting the Wi-Fi.

 The latest Windows 11 Canary build 25997 has a bunch of other bug fixes, improves Windows Share, and a way to quickly turn off Phone Link. You'll also find fixes for context menus randomly going transparent and a problem where booting into safe mode would stall.
