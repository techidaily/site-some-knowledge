## Harnessing the Power of Look-Up Tables in Film Grading

Color Grading Central is a company created by Denver Riddle, who is currently involved in the production of films. LUTs and other video color grading plugins of this company are inspired by some of the best Hollywood movies.

LUTs or Look Up Tables are nothing more than a table of numbers that apply a color transformation to an image. However, what makes color gradation LUTs unique is their ability to apply predetermined sets of mathematical formulas to the existing colors of your video to change those colors to achieve the desired result. Now it's possible to accurately imitate all the subtle nuances and color shifts of your favorite movie!

The Color Grading Central LUTs effect is stylish and cinematic.

## Part 2\. How to use Luts from color grading central to color grading for movies?

![color grading for movies](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-central-2.jpg)

Color grading is one way to enhance the look of your shots and serve your narrative vision. That's why many filmmakers, editors, and colorists working on film use Look Up Tables, or LUTs, to store color grades as templates to help speed up the process.

We're letting you know that you don't have to work on the film to use LUTs to help personalize and mark your videos. If you're wondering how you can get started with color grading to speed up your workflow and create better-looking shots for your business, we've got you covered.

**LUTs in Movies**

Various LUT types are employed during post-production for color grading and color correction.

First, the two LUT formats work differently. **A 1D LUT** (usually. lut format) controls a single parameter, generally gamma. A 1D LUT takes a sort of blanket approach; the adjustment applies to everything in the image without much flexibility. One parameter affects all colors, saturations, and contrast. **A 3D LUT** (usually a. cube format) has three axes that independently adjust Hue, Saturation, Luminance, Gamma, and Contrast and can change as conditions in the image change. As such, a 3D LUT is much more flexible and powerful and is the only way to achieve a truly cinematic color grade with LUT.

The other two types of LUTs can be either 1D or 3D LUTs, but these days they are most often 3D LUTs. The difference between them is when in the process you use them and for what purpose.

![luts in movies](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-central-3.jpg)

An input or camera LUT used at the beginning of the color correction process adjusts the footage so that the color correction tools work correctly. Color corrected recordings that require an input or camera LUT without one can lead to unexpected and unsatisfactory results.

Conversely, you typically apply a LUT look after you've done color correction and moved on to the color grading phase. Use it to dial in the exact artistic look you want. The Look LUT contains instructions to create a predetermined desired look for your shots, which can be an incredible time saver in the color grading process.

Always colorize an appearance LUT correctly before applying it, as appearance LUTs assume an underlying natural color. If you don't, you may not see the results that the LUT is supposed to give you.

LUTs are specially designed for different recording types â€“ LOG, RAW, Rec.709, Rec.2020, HDR, and more. You can apply any LUT to any footage, but if you apply a LUT designed for a specific type of footage to another type, you can end up with a very different look than what you expected. But then it can also give you a result you like, so you are free to experiment as you wish. LUTs are non-destructive, so you can load and delete them at will.

Many camera manufacturers, software companies, and independent producers offer downloadable LUTs or LUT packs. They often design these skins for specific purposes, such as color correcting footage captured by their cameras or to mimic signature skins seen in movies and TV shows. These skins can give you exactly the color class you want, or you can use them and keep tweaking and tweaking to get the perfect look.

## Part 3\. Free LUTs sources

Cinematic LUTs are pre-saved settings that make color grading easy and efficient, allowing you to enhance your videos with just a few clicks. By using a color tinting effect, changing the brightness of the video, or richer colors, you will achieve professional results in no time, regardless of the software product you are using.

LUTs are shared in the .cube file format, which is supported by the most popular video editors, such as DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro CC, After Effects CC, and Sony Vegas.

Despite having the latest filmmaking technology at our fingertips, there is something about the old film look that looks amazing.

Frank Glencairn created a great K-Tone LUT designed to mimic the style of vintage Kodachrome film. Once widely used by photographers and filmmakers, this film grade has fallen out of favor with the rise of digital cameras.
