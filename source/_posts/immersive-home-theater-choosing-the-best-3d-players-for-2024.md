## What is important for choosing 3D Blu-ray Player?

There are so many things to know about Blu-ray players and you must go through these details before investing on new software. If you are a beginner then just 3D performance monitoring will be useful for you but for advanced users, features like classic HDMI color calibration and 4K upscaling are essential to maintain high picture quality at home screens. Same as internal specifications, you may find so many variations in port options and they must be considered on preferences during selection. Note that coaxial output will not be a good choice for high quality content but optical cables can ensure theatre like setup.

### Support for Streaming Apps

These Blu-Ray players are not just limited to movie playbacks rather they can also provide advanced home theatre experience with easy access to Netflix and Hulu based streaming.

### DLNA Support

If you are a professional then you may also demand DLNA support on your player so that multimedia content can be easily streamed on local network at your TV screen. Top blu-ray players can provide you such advanced services.

### Dimensions and Design

In case if you are thinking to install your Blu-ray player in an already loaded home theatre then its dimensions are really important. You must pick the one with minimal cabling requirement and a lightweight design. Note that, multipurpose type models are designed with unique combinations of 3D functionality and all other essential features including streaming capabilities but these units naturally grow up bigger in size.

### Are the New 4K 3d Blu-ray Players worth Buying?

You can enjoy 4K experience on HD TVs and it offers quality much higher than 1080p or 720p. What kind of content you need to produce at home and does your screen offers that quality will make final decision about whether you should invest on 4K versions of these players or not.
