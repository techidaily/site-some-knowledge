You'll need more than just great photos. You'll also need to use the right tools and apps to help you grow your account. Instagram Stars typically use a variety of apps to help them with everything from editing their photos to scheduling their posts. They also often use analytics tools to track their growth and engagement.

Using the right tools and apps, you can give yourself a leg up on the competition and start building your own following.

## 6\. Follow other Instagram stars

If you're hoping to become an Instagram star, one of the best things you can do is follow other Instagram stars. Not only will this give you an idea of what it takes to be successful on Instagram, but it will also help you build up a following of your own.

Though, there are a few things to keep in mind when you're following Instagram stars.

* Make sure that you're only following accounts that are relevant to your interests. There's no point in following someone who doesn't post content you're interested in.
* Take the time to engage with the content that you're seeing. Like and comment on photos and videos, and start conversations with other users. By taking the time to interact with the content on Instagram, you'll begin to build up a following of your own.
* Don't be afraid to experiment with your content. Instagram is all about creativity, so try posting something different from time to time. Mixing things up will keep your followers engaged and coming back for more.

So, if you're hoping to become an Instagram star, don't forget to follow other Instagram stars. It's a great way to start your journey to Instagram success.

## 7\. Use hashtags to get more followers

![use hashtags to get more followers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-an-instagram-star-07.jpg)

For many Instagram stars, hashtags played a crucial role in helping them to get more followers and grow their businesses.

By carefully selecting and using relevant hashtags, Instagram stars can reach a much wider audience than they would if they relied solely on their existing network of followers. When used correctly, hashtags can help Instagram stars appear in the top posts for specific keywords, exposing them to a whole new group of potential followers.

In addition, many Instagram users actively search for new content using hashtags, which means that using the right hashtags can help you attract an engaged audience that is genuinely interested in what you offer.

So, if you want to become an Instagram star, don't underestimate the power of a good hashtag strategy!
