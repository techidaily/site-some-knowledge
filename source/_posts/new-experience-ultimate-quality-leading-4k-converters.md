## Part 1: Is a 4K video necessary for YouTube?

Though 4K video is supported by YouTube, these are not at all necessary for YouTube. In fact, uploading a 4K video is more of a hassle as it not only takes a lot of time but needs to adhere to the set file parameters. Moreover, these 4K videos are cumbersome to edit and also, and they are not supported by a wide range of media players and devices. The large size of the 4K videos also prevents them from being shared over email and other platforms.

Considering all these factors, downscaling 4K videos to 1080p/HD is the best solution as this will not hamper the video quality and will also make the uploading, editing, and playback easy.
