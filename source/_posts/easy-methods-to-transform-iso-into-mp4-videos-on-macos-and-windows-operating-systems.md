**ISO** is a sector-by-sector copy of the data on an optical disc. An ISO image contains all contents of the disc, such as the menu, the main movie, every single track and information about the disc structure. Such kind of file makes up for the flaw in DVD that is vulnerable to scratch and can be easily transferred over the internet. 

The regrettable things are that ISO images are stored in an uncompressed format **(usually 4-8GB)** and so far there is no mobile device supports ISO image. So if you want to play ISO image on iPhone, iPad, Android, or other devices, you need to convert ISO to MP4.

In this article, we'll explore a variety of ways to convert ISO to MP4, including both free and paid options.

### How to Convert and Compress ISO to MP4 with MacX DVD Ripper Pro 

To begin with, you need to download and install MacX DVD Ripper Pro on your computer. Both Windows and Mac are supported. Once done, you can follow the steps below to convert an ISO file to an MP4 file.

[Download for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) [Download for PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) 

**Step 1\. Load the DVD ISO file.**

 To begin the conversion process, open this ISO to MP4 converter and then click the "ISO Image " button to open the ISO file you want to convert. 

After you open it, MacX DVD Ripper Pro will start analyzing it in no time.During the analysis, the software will determine which is the main movie title and will select it for you automatically. However, you can always choose a different title or select multiple titles to convert.

![Best ISO to MP4 converter](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/mdrp-interface-700.jpg) 

**Step 2\. Select MP4 as the output format.**

After the ISO file has been analyzed, it's time to select the output format. Simply go to "General Profiles" and select "MP4 Video (H264)" as the output format. Alternatively, you can choose "Mac General Video" and select "MP4 Video (HEVC)". HEVC offers the same quality but 50% smaller in size than H264 codec. MacX DVD Ripper Pro also includes ready profiles for the latest mobiles, web, TV, iMovie, QuickTime, etc.

**Step 3\. Start the ISO to MP4 conversion process.**

Once you have selected the output format, click on the "RUN" button to begin the conversion process.

 If your computer supports GPU HW acceleration, the software will automatically select the "Hardware Encoder" option located at the lower right corner of the home screen to speed up the conversion process. If not, it's recommended to use a high-end desktop to avoid CPU high usage and overheating problems. 

Tips: If you find that the output MP4 file size is too large, you can adjust the resolution (640\*480 recommended) and lower the bit rate by 20-50% compared to its default setting to further reduce the file size.

## Method 2\. Convert ISO to MP4 for Free with HandBrake

Compatible OS: Mac, Windows, Linux  
 Free or paid: free

Can [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) convert ISO to MP4? Yes. HandBrake can convert ISO images to MP4 format, as long as the ISO image is not copy-protected. However, if you encounter an encrypted ISO image, you can try installing [libdvdcss](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and see if it can help HandBrake access the protected content.

HandBrake is a completely free and ad-free program. Despite being free, it is well-designed and packed with many features. HandBrake offers a variety of presets, though not as extensive as those offered by MacX DVD Ripper Pro. In addition, HandBrake provides a range of video filters, such as deinterlacing, decomb, and denoise. You can also customize various settings, such as codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and more - similar to MacX DVD Ripper Pro.

HandBrake is not only capable of converting ISO images, but also videos, DVDs, and Blu-ray sources. Besides MP4, it can also convert your videos and disc sources to MKV and WebM. If you're new to HandBrake, this is definitely a program worth checking out.

**Pros:**

* Free and open-source.
* Multi-platform.
* User-friendly interface.
* It offers a wide range of advanced settings.
* A lot of video codecs to choose.
* It supports Blu-ray ISO files.

**Cons:**

* It doesn't support copy-protected ISO files.
* Handbrake can be slow when converting large ISO files, especially on older computers.

### How to convert ISO to MP4 for free with HandBrake

**Step 1.** Install HandBrake on your computer. You can download the latest version of HandBrake from its official website.

**Step 2.** Launch HandBrake and click on "File" under "Source Selection" to browse and select the ISO file that you want to convert.

**Step 3.** Once the ISO file is selected, HandBrake will scan and analyze it. Under the "Title" section, select the title and chapter you want to convert to MP4.

**Step 4.** Under the "Presets" section, choose a preset that suits your needs. For example, you can select "Fast 720p 30" for a high-quality output or "Fast 480p 30" for a smaller output size.

**Step 5.** Under the "Format" section, select "MP4" as the output format. Then, choose the destination folder where you want to save the converted file.

**Step 6.** Finally, click on the "Start Encode" button to start the conversion process.

## Method 3\. Convert ISO to MP4 for Free with VLC

Compatible OS: Mac, Windows, Linux  
 Free or paid: free

It's true that VLC can support you to freely rip an MP4 file from ISO image. And you can't blame it if it doesn't live up to your anticipation, for it's just freeware and the developer team members are not so enough as the paid products to constantly update the program to satisfy your every need. So in short, VLC is great in case you just need it to handle the unprotected ISO image conversion without any dent in your wallet. 

Personally, I adore VLC media player a lot as it covers multiple features into one: video playback, video conversion, video editing and ISO image conversion. Yet, advanced GPU hardware acceleration tech is absent from this excellent toolbox. It only supports the basic "Video Decode Acceleration Framework", which actually has few influence on ISO image transcoding speed. I use VLC to convert THOR.iso (7.5GB) file and choose MP4 (H264) as output format. Have to admit that it's quite easy to conduct the conversion.

**Pros:**

* Free and open-source.
* It's a multifunctional tool.

**Cons:**

* It does not have dedicated customer support.
* It may not work with your encrypted ISO files.
* Slow conversion.

**Step 1.** Open VLC Media Player on your computer if you already have it installed.

**Step 2.** Tap "Media" from the top menu and select "Convert/Save...".

**Step 3.** Click "+ Add" to import the ISO file you want to convert. Then, tap "Convert/save..." at the bottom.

![Import ISO to VLC](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/vlc-open-iso-to-convert.jpg) 

**Step 4.** Select an MP4 profile from the dropdown menu of Profile. 

![Free convert iso image to MP4 with VLC](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/vlc-convert-iso-to-mp4.jpg) 

**Step 5.** Click the "Browse" button to choose the destination folder where you want to save the converted file and name it.

**Step 6.** Click on "Start" to begin the conversion process.

## Method 4\. Convert ISO to MP4 for Free with ffmpeg

Compatible OS: Mac, Windows, Linux  
 Free or paid: free

Yes, you can use FFmpeg to convert an ISO file to an MP4 file. To do this, you need to open a command prompt or terminal window and enter the appropriate command. The command may vary slightly depending on your operating system and the specific ISO file you want to convert.

Here is an example command for converting an ISO file to MP4 with FFmpeg:

ffmpeg -i input.iso -c:v libx264 -crf 20 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 192k output.mp4 

In this command:

* input.iso is the name and location of your input ISO file.
* \-c:v libx264 specifies the video codec to use (H.264).
* \-crf 20 sets the video quality. Lower values produce higher quality but larger files, and higher values produce lower quality but smaller files. A value of 20 is a good balance between quality and file size.
* \-preset medium specifies the encoding speed and quality. The "medium" preset provides a good balance between speed and quality.
* \-c:a aac -b:a 192k specifies the audio codec to use (AAC) and the audio bitrate (192 kbps).
* output.mp4 is the name and location of your output MP4 file.

After entering the command, FFmpeg will start the conversion process. The time it takes to complete will depend on the size of the input file and the speed of your computer.

## Method 5\. Convert ISO to MP4 Online

Compatible OS: Mac, Windows, Linux  
 Free or paid: free but with maximum file size limitation

It is possible to convert ISO to MP4 online using various free online converters. However, it's important to note that online conversion tools often have file size limitations, may not be as reliable as desktop software, and may compromise the privacy and security of your files. For instance, file-converter-online.com allows users to convert ISO to MP4 online. However, free users are only allowed to upload files smaller than 0.75 GB. If you wish to upload larger files, you will need to sign up for an account.

To convert ISO to MP4 online in file-converter-online.com, follow the steps.

Step 1\. Open https://iso-to-mp4.file-converter-online.com/ in your browser.

Step 2\. Click the "Choose File" button to open and upload the ISO file you wish to convert to MP4.

Step 3\. Click the drop-menu of "Choose filetype" and select MP4.

Step 4\. Hit the "Start Converting!" to begin converting ISO to MP4.

![Convert ISO to MP4 online](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/iso-to-mp4-online.jpg) 

If you decide to use an online ISO to MP4 converter, make sure to choose a reputable and trustworthy website, and be cautious about uploading sensitive or copyrighted materials. Additionally, be aware that online converters may take longer to process the conversion than desktop software, and may not have as many customization options.

Overall, while online ISO to MP4 converters can be a convenient option, they may not provide the same level of quality, speed, and security as desktop software alternatives.
