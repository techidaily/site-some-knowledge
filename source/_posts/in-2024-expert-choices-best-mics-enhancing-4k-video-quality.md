 Those who are interested to record audios with high quality content delivery are not advised to work with the built in type microphones of camcorders. The reason behind is that these mics often pick too much details from surroundings, they add unwanted noise to data and people often lose important details from videos. But now with the external microphone connectivity options, you can enjoy high quality results for each editing project. Generally all external microphones are designed to work with 4K cameras but still selection can become confusing with lots of similar kind of products available in market.

 This article can help you to gain complete information about top 5 external microphones that can be used with 4K cameras. It will improve your decision making ability with great information update so keep reading.

## Before Choosing the Microphones for 4K Camera

 The selection process for external microphones demands buyer’s attention as they need to focus on several major details to get the right one. If you need a mic for consumer camcorders then they are equipped with a stereo jack that allows easy connection with the external mic but in case of high end camcorders you will find an XLR type jack to make connection with external mic. So before purchasing a new camera, you need to check these details so that proper connections can be developed. Chose a mic that fits to available jack.

## Types of 4K Camera Microphones

 You will find three popular types of camcorder microphones in the market; they are handheld, lapel and shotgun. Each one of these has unique applications as professionals use them for variable video production needs. If you are thinking to invest on a new mic then you must collect few basic details about these three mic types:

#### 1. Shotgun Microphones

 The mics can be easily attached to boom pole or can make connection with camcorders. They are capable enough to pick sound from specific directions to which they are pointed. Some of the most common application of shotgun mics is in video production as they can pick specific sound when environment is loaded with multiple speakers.

#### 2. Lapel Microphones

 These types of microphones are suitable for recording interviews because they can be easily attached to shirt of the speaker. With such type of close connection they become capable enough to pick sound with crisp details. One more application of Lapel Microphones is in wedding video recording needs.

#### 3. Handheld Microphones

 This collection is useful for heavy duty needs as they are capable enough to pick sound from reasonable nearby distance. Those who need to add the newcaster type feeling to their video shoots can prefer to use handheld type mics.
