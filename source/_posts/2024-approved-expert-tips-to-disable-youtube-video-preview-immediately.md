1. **\-keyword**will omit all videos with a specific keyword from your search engine. For example, typing **Matchday Results -highlights** will eliminate all videos with the word highlight from your search results.
2. **Allintitle: Keyword1 keyword 2** generates video search results with both keywords in their title. For example, **allintitle: megan harry wedding**will only give you videos with all three keywords in the title.

### Always view YouTube with the best resolution. (Desktop)

Are you always changing the video quality for your YouTube videos? Well, you can rest free because you can customize the app to only play the best quality videos. Currently, the AV1 codec is the most popular video compression technology for the online video streaming industry.

4. Finally, when you search 301 views or 301 videos, the search results will feature a video by Numberphile that has been stuck there since it was first uploaded. It explains an earlier YouTube bug that caused the view counter to sticking at 301 views for several hours after uploading.
