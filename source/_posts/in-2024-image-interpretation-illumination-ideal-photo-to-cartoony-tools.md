Besides enhancing the photos you take with your Smartphone or your DSLR camera, you can use [photo editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to produce images that don’t look realistic. Cartooning a photo is one out of many options nearly all desktop-based photo editors offer, although in most cases you will have to combine several effects in order to cartoon your pictures.

However, photo to cartoon software products require some previous photo editing experience since you will have to do much more than apply an effect to a photo in order to make a photo look like a cartoon. We’ve selected some of the **best photo to cartoon software** products that can help you create stunning cartoons from your photos.

## Top 10 Photo to Cartoon Software Products for Windows & Mac

Even though you can cartoon photos with each photo to cartoon software we included in this article, which effects you will have to use depends on the software and the style of the cartoon you’re trying to create. So, let’s take a look at what these photo to cartoon software products have to offer.

Effects such as Sketch, Ink Outlines, or Cutout can all be used during this process, and you can also combine several effects while turning a photo into a cartoon. Needless to say, inexperienced photo editors can find this task overwhelming, because it requires a lot of patience and excellent knowledge of the software’s features.

What’s more, you’ll have to convert your photos into vector drawings before you can import them into Adobe 2D Animation Software and use them to make a cartoon.
