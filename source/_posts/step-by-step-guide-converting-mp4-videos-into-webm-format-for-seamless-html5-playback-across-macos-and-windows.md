## Why Convert MP4 to WebM 

Before explaining why you need to create WebM video from [MP4 video](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), you shall have a good understanding of HTML5\. The fifth version of HTML standard is used for presenting content on world wide web, which has been used by 75.3% of all the websites on PC/Mac and phones as of now. With many newly added elements like <video>, <audio>, etc, HTML5 now makes your media files truly accessible without add-ons. It's proved that [MP4 and WebM](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) are two of the main formats for HTML5 video. 

Actually, both MP4 and WebM feature high compression ratio and are commonly used for online streaming, but more so with the latter. If you get a download of 1080p HD video from YouTube in MP4 or WebM, you will notice that the file size in WebM (33.32MB) is about 47% smaller than that in MP4 (49.03MB). Besides the high bandwidth usage and small size in WebM, the video format is open-source, royalty free, and is supported by many browsers, while MP4 is patented and non-free format. That's way the HTML video in MP4 can be only accessible if you have licenses from the individual patent holders. If you have a lot of MP4 videos and want to access or embed MP4 videos on HTML5 page, the best solution is to convert MP4 to WebM first using a [MP4 video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).
