_I was just wondering what format everyone uses to watch movies on your Macs. Everyone in my dorm is totally stoked on the Divx and Xvid formats but I couldn't seem to get them to run on my girlfriends iBook. Also I was wondering what formats offer the best compression/playback quality? I plan on buying the next revision of PowerBook and using it to rip DVDs and such so I was just wondering what software I will need. Thanks for all the help. - MacRumors_

## Part 2: What is the Best Video Format for macOS?

The following will list the **best video format Mac supports** and codecs you will need for a successful playback on your Mac (MacBook/MBP/iMac).

MOV video file uses a proprietary compression algorithm developed by Apple Computer. Mac still remains supreme with the .mov and .mpeg file types. Naturally, MOV is the standard and best video format for Mac. It is known to have the best video quality of all three streaming formats listed here.

### **[MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)** (A digital multimedia format most commonly used to store video and audio, subtitles and still images.)

MP4 (MPEG 4) is actually a standard that Apple really pushed with Quicktime 6\. So, accordingly, you can use .mp4 format just fine on a Mac. Attention shall be paid it's possible that what's going on is that they use the MPEG4 architecture but they're using a weird codec. Between the native QT7 codecs, the Perian ones, and Flip4Mac, you are mostly covered. But MP4 files encoded with MPEG-4 video or H.264 (preferred) video are also considered as one of the best video formats compatible with Mac OS. 

### **M4V**  (A video container format developed by Apple and is very similar to the MP4 format.)

Generally, Apple uses M4V encode video files, such as TV episodes, movies, and music videos, in its iTunes Store. The copyright of M4V files may be protected by using Apple's FairPlay DRM copy protection.
