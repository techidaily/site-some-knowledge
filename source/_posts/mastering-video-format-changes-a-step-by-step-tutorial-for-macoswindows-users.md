## Know More about Video Codec

### **What is video codec and how it differs from container format**?

Video codec is not a video format. The codec is a compression standard responsible for encoding and decoding video streams. Codecs are used to compress(encode) video size and then decompress(decode) it when needed. Most popular video codecs include H.264, H.265, MPEG, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, VP8, VP9, DivX, XviD and others. Different video codecs are for different intended uses, that's why a video codec converting software is needed from time to time. 

A [container format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital%5Fcontainer%5Fformat) stores video codec, audio codec and other data, for example, subtitles, chapter information, into one package. A container format can contain different types of codecs. An MP4 format can be encoded with H.264 or MPEG-4 video codec, and MP3 or AAC audio codec or others. The most popular container formats are MP4, AVI, MKV, FLV, to name a few. The above video codec converter also works as the [best video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) that is able to convert among HD/SD video formats, such as MKV to MP4, FLV to AVI, [WMV to MOV](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), MP4 to MP3, [AVI to MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), to name a few.
