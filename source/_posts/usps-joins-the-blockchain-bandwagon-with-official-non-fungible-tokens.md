## USPS Joins the Blockchain Bandwagon with Official Non-Fungible Tokens

Stamps from the Post Office are among the most popular collectible items, and the USPS is taking that idea to the next level with its own [NFTs](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/techniques-for-writing-eye-catching-podcast-summaries/). It brings that same level of collectability from the world of physical stamps to digital ones.

 The [United States Postal Service](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-country-on-app-store-for-apple-iphone-8-with-7-methods-by-drfone-ios/) and [VeVe](https://medium.com/veve-collectibles/usps-series-1-day-of-the-dead-b5891e0d0baa) (which also released NFTs from brands like Marvel) partnered to create NFTs back in November 2021, and the postal service talked about them again on its ["mailin' it" podcast](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher%5Fslug=howtogeek&u1=UUhtgUeUpU207169&article%5Fname=Even+USPS+Has+NFTs+Now&article%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F781403%2Feven-usps-has-nfts-now%2F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fmailin-it-the-official-usps-podcast%2Fid1587184784). (Did you know USPS had a podcast? We sure didn't.)

 The original batch of NFTs was dedicated to DÃ­a de Los Muertos, and there were four unique NFTs to get. Each one was limited to a few thousand copies. They weren't costly at launch, with each selling for $6\. However, they did sell out quickly, and now they're going for a minimum of $195 on VeVe's secondary market, so they weren't a bad investment at their launch price.

 The USPS has since released four other NFTs on the VeVe marketplace, all of which are Christmas-themed as part of its A Visit From ST. Nick collection. The rarest of these is currently commanding upwards of $250, so it seems there's a market for these USPS NFTs after all.
