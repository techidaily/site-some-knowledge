Compress Video by: 30% | | Performance: 95% 

Before you try third-party video compression software on Mac, you should know that some of Mac's built-in free compressor apps have some basic video compression features for different purposes. The first we would like to recommend to you is Finder. It offers video compression and decompression on Mac in the ZIP format. That means videos can be compressed without losing quality on Mac during the compression. 

However, in other words, the output file size of the compressed video won't be too much smaller than that of the original video, though the actual amount of compression will depend on the type of your file. 

**How do I compress video files in Mac Finder?** 

**Step 1.** Open Finder and select the video or video folder in the Finder. Right-click on it and select "Compress file name".

**Step 2.** The Mac will begin to compress the video. Once finished, a .zip file with the same name will be displayed next to the file you selected. 

![Can Finder compress videos on Mac](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/finder-compress.jpg) 

**Step 3.** The zip file contains the compressed video and your original video is untouched. Double-click on it to decompress the zip file and the Mac will extract the files right next to it.[For information on Finder compressing video on Mac here](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

Apple's default media player actually can help free compress videos on Mac. There are options to adjust the video resolution to 4K, 1080P, 720P, and 480P to make your videos smaller. The drawback to it is that it offers only a few options to reduce the file size on Mac, but it gets the results done. Another thing to note is the compressed output video will be encoded in MOV format, regardless of the import format. 

**How do I compress video on Mac with QuickTime Player?** 

**Step 1.** To make a video smaller for free, open the app from your Applications folder. Click File > Open File to navigate to the video that you want to compress and open it.

To downsize your video on Mac without noticeable quality loss, you're suggested to compress videos to a resolution slightly lower than the original quality. For example, you can compress 4K to 1080P to get a relatively good result. 

![Best free video compressor app for Mac](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/quicktime-compress.jpg)
