AZW4 is an Amazon proprietary format for textbooks. It is a PDF format in a PDB wrapper, and usually with DRM. The wrapper provides the same DRM method as is used on the Kindle's Mobipocket format e-books. Azw4 is a new format for Amazon and so far this is only supported on Kindle for PC and Kindle for Mac applications.

 Besides, it is expected to be rolled out on other Kindle Reading Apps and on the Kindle DX at some point. With the restriction of the Kindle DRM protection, if you want to share your books with other people or convert the e-books to other formats like Epub/PDF, you can only choose to remove their DRM first. 

If you have installed Calibre and expect to use Calibre to manage your e-book library, you can use Calibre to operate. Calibre supports both Windows and Mac OS X, but this plugin might not be run on Calibre 64 bit version. Calibre Plugins supports to remove DRM from Kindle azw4, but it's really difficult and bothering to remove DRM with Calibre. Why? Because it relies on two other component plugins, After you download and install Calibre, you need to download and install Python 2.6 and pyCtypto as well. Thus, I strongly disapprove of this method. I wish to recommend you a much more easier and better way to remove DRM from azw4\. It will help you save much time and energy.

 Next I'm going to introduce you the best way to remove DRM from azw4!

Additional tips:  

Once the AZW4 books has been decrypted, when you check out the output folder, you will not see the book title with the extension .azw again, but .pdf. How magic it is! The main reason of this change is because the azw4 file is Amazon exclusive PDF format. They just add a wrapper of the PDF. The DRM has been remove, you see the essential element of this file.
