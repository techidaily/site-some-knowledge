Gravit Designer works both online and offline which enables you to work on new projects regardless of where you currently are. However, you will need at least a basic set of designing skills to start working with this app, since the tools it offers are not aimed at the newcomers to the design world.

In addition, the app lets you set the Size and Opacity of all drawing tools so that you can adjust them to the drawing you’re working on.
