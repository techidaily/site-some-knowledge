Although GoPro cameras can be easily controlled via voice controls but it also suffers with noise from surrounding environment. Thus manufacturers have recently launched voice activated waterproof remote that you can easily attach to your clothes or wrist. Its built in type mic will easily capture the sound from your mouth and allow camera to perform operations accordingly.

#### 11.Anti-Fog Inserts

If you need a fog free arrangement for humid environments then it is good to buy [Anti Fog inserts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for your GoPro camera. The pack usually includes 12 different inserts whereas each one of these can be used four times without any damage. To buy this accessory you need to pay $11\. Many GoPro owners include this in their essential GoPro accessory list and prefer to put in their bag during adventurous tours. These inserts will never let fog cover your camera lens during shooting at humid environment.

#### 12.GoPro Quick Key

In case if you need a system to easily transfer your footage from GoPro camera to tablet or microphone then Quick Key will do this task easily. These accessories usually come in form of USB-C or Micro USB and sometimes in lighting variants. Simply insert your GoPro MicroSD card from one end and insert the other terminal on your device; it will easily begin the file transfer process. It can be easily connected to a key chain for easy access but you need to pay more to buy this accessory. It costs somewhere around $20 and also offers WiFi connectivity for direct connection so that Footage can be transferred anytime.
