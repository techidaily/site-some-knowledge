Antix is a special kind of application that makes use of the motion sensors of your smartphone in order to detect when some exciting action is happening. However, the app developers still haven’t revealed what exactly is deemed exciting by this app. It would recommend the key scenes by a comparison of the recorded motion footage from your phone with the help of the video stream of your GoPro.

### 3. [KineMaster](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexstreaming.app.kinemasterfree)

This video editor is multiple timeline editing. The slow-motion editor can empower the details of your exciting moments, which means viewers can have more engagement with your GoPro videos. The power of this app derives from an algorithm that would help you to find the most exciting snippets from your recordings and edit them promptly into shareable bits. You can also choose to add any background sound to your video wither from the mic of your phone or from a preselected list of licensed tracks.

### 4\. [PowerDirector for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyberlink.powerdirector.DRA140225%5F01)

Comes with loads of features like timeline video editing, cool video effects, slo-mo, a photo-video editor, and lots more. This app is all you need to share cool videos on Vine or YouTube. The footage from your action cam can be edited just like you do it on Magisto or Final Cut. Now you can rotate, trip, split, and even create the coolest slo-mo videos just like GoPro. All you have to do is add the videos for your timeline and start editing.

No matter if you are on the train, on the beach, or hiking in the mountains this cool app would allow you to edit your videos no matter where you are. You can now shoot some amazing moments with your phone and just import the recordings. The video camera app is very useful for quickly deleting unwanted scenes and arranging the clips.

### 6. [Splice](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/splice-free-video-editor-movie-maker-by-gopro/id409838725?mt=8)

If more precise control is what you are after then you need to go for Splice.

### 8\. [GoFix](https://gofix-remove-distortion-from-gopro-photos-ios.soft112.com/modal-download.html)

Though your action camera would allow you to take photos in situations in which most other cameras won't allow, your photos are going to be a bit distorted because of the fisheye effect on GoPro. Though many of us prefer the fisheye look, you can always choose to do away with it by using the GoFix app. With the GoFix app, you no longer need to worry about those curved horizons.

![gopro editing apps GoFix](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/gofix.jpg)

With this clean and simple to use GoPro control, you can record audio, add speedometer to your video and connect your camera automatically. If you like to record your audio while shooting a GoPro video, this GoPro software is best for you.
