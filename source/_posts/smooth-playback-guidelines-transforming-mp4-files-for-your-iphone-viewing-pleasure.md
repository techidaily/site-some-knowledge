Reason 1: iPhone accepts video files with .mp4 file extension. But iDevice doesn't support all the varieties of .mp4\. Only the .mp4 file encoded by **H264/HEVC/MPEG-4/Motion JPEG** video and AAC audio codecs can be successfully transferred to iPhone with no problem.  
 Reason 2: why iTunes can play local MP4 files while iPhone can't? Your MP4 file **parameter**  settings should take responsibility, incl. resolution, frame rate, etc.  
 Reason 3: this is to explain why online MP4 video isn't playing in Safari on iPhone. Because **HTML5 player** delivers an in-and-out showing on iPhone.

In short, iPhone MP4 problems are mainly caused by MP4 codecs, MP4 parameter settings and HTML5 player. Hence, our workarounds are converting MP4 codecs, adjust MP4 parameters and download MP4 video to iPhone without using HTML5 player any more. Now let's suit the remedy to the case one by one.
