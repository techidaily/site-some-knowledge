### How to Use Calibre Companion to Sync, Download and Read Books

As the official recommended APP, Calibre Companion (CC) is your first choice of Calibre Android Apps. You can use it to sync Calibre Library, Send Calibre eBooks from computer to your phone, download Calibre eBooks to read. Following is the detailed guide about how to collect your phone with Calibre computer program and sync, manage, download and read eBooks.

#### STEP 1: Download & Install Necessary Programs

[Download Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download) which suits with your computer system. Then install Calibre on your computer. Make sure you download the newest version.

Download Calibre Companion Apk from Google Play Store. And install it on your mobile phone.

Download an Android reader for use with Calibre: Moon+ Reader; FBReader (These two Android readers are recommended by CC officially.) 

If you have an eBook reader which can be invoked from Calibre Companion, there is no need to install another one.

#### STEP 2: Setup Calibre on Computer

**1.** Launch Calibre on your PC. Click "Connect/share" option on the navigation. Then click "Start Content server" and "Start wireless device connection" from the drop-down list.

![calibre connect share](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/calibre-connect-share.png)

**2.** Click "Start wireless device connection" option will jump out of a window. Check "Use a fixed port" option. Then click "OK".

![calibre smart device control](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/calibre-smart-device-control.png)

**3.** Check if the content server is running. When click "Connect/share" option again, you will find out that there is an IP address after each option.

![calibre content server](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/calibre-content-server.png)

Open that address after "Stop Content server" on your computer which is running Calibre. You can use a browser such as Chrome or Firefox.

The IP address of content server like this: http://192.168.1.103:8080  
 Or you can open one of below address to check  
 http://127.0.0.1:8080  
 http://localhost:8080

After opening the address, when you see the Calibre Library, it means the content server is running normally. You can read and download eBooks in Calibre Library by the IP address.

**4.** Remember those two IP address. Here are my examples:  
 Content server: http://192.168.1.103:8080  
 Wireless device connection: http://192.168.1.103:9090

#### STEP 3: Setup Home Network Connection

This is the important step to connect Calibre with CC. 

**Be sure:**  
 1\. No Virtual Private Network (VPN) is running on your computer or phone.  
 2\. The WiFi used by the phone is the same network as the computer.  
 3\. The firewall or anti-virus allows "The main calibre program" to communicate on the private network.

**For Windows 7:**  
 Open the Control Panel of your computer. If you don't know where it is, you can search "Control Panel" from the start menu. Find and click "Windows Firewall". Then click "Allow a program or feature through Windows Firewall". And find out "The main calibre program" and check "Home/Work (Private)".

![allow the main calibre program through windows firewall](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/allow-the-main-calibre-program-through-windows-firewall.png)

**For Windows 10:**  
 When you click "Start Content server" option, it will pop up a "Windows Security Alert" window. Check "Private networks" and Click "Allow access".

Looking for a good way to access my Calibre library from a cloud (preferably from Sugarsync).   
 I will be travelling for several months with my Samsung Tab s2\. My computer with my Calibre library and internet service at home will be turned off.   
 Have read that Google cloud is not really compatible with Calibre and that the app "Calibre Cloud" is not reliable.   
 I can access my Cloud based account to download specific books, but would like to be able to search my library also.  
 Any suggestions?
