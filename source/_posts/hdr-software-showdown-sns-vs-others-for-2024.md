HDR, or High Dynamic Range, photography is an excellent technique for capturing images as seen by our eyes. With this technique, you can capture the dark and light tones in the scenery.

The science behind it is that the camera captures a scene twice or thrice with different exposures. Then, it combines all the exposures and creates an image that focuses on the dark and the light tones.

There are different scenarios where HDR photography can be helpful. Especially in spaces where you have to capture the whole landscape or the true colors of the sky.

Such a user interface is beneficial for new users as they don't have to put in a lot of effort to get used to it.

This is helpful when you take batch photos with your camera. These photos should preferably have different exposures so that you can use SNS HDR's batch processing feature to combine all the different exposures to get a single picture with all the right tones.

**_3\._ _Built-in and User Presets_**

Another cool feature that SNS HDR Pro has is that it provides its users with built-in presets. You can use these presets by clicking on them. They are present on the left side of the screen. As the name suggests, these presets are an already constructed set of settings. When you click on them, those specific settings are applied to the image.

This is helpful as you do not have to go through the tedious task of adjusting each aspect of the image yourself. If you want to finish your editing quickly, presets are your best option.

Moreover, you can also create your own presets and save them for future use.

**_4\._ _Masks_**

Masking is another feature that SNS HDR Pro offers. Using this feature, you can edit specific parts of your image. Usually, when you add an effect, the whole picture changes according to it.
