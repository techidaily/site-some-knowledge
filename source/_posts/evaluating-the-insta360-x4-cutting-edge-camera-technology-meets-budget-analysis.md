## Evaluating the Insta360 X4: Cutting-Edge Camera Technology Meets Budget Analysis

### Key Takeaways

* The camera can shoot 8K footage, but 4K is more practical for most users due to storage, editing, and performance.
* The Insta360 X4 offers high-quality video, waterproof housing, swappable lenses, and easy editing software.
* Priced at $500, the X4 provides impressive capabilities for capturing 360-degree content, but may not be worth it for all users.

 The [Insta360 X4](https://www.amazon.com/Insta360-Waterproof-Wide-Angle-Invisible-Stabilization/dp/B0CXPWMZQS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003236&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Finsta360-x4-camera-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is the latest iteration of the company’s infamous 360-degree camera.

##  Simple Hardware Design That Doesn’t Stray From Previous Models

![The power and quick settings button on the Insta360 X4](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/the-power-and-quick-settings-button-on-the-insta360-x4_53647692914_o.jpg)

 The latest Insta360 X4 bears a striking resemblance to its slightly older sibling, the X3\. With a very similar overall design, there’s not much that’s changed externally here. Physically, there’s no difference here. The same accessories work between the two, and if you’re used to the button layout on the X3, you’ll be right at home on the X4.

 At the bottom right, there’s the mode button. This lets you flip between video, active HDR, timelapse, time shift, bullet time, and more. Plus, it lets you toggle photo or video mode. To the left of that is the shutter, which has a new feature this time around. Of course, clicking it starts and stops recording, but, if you accidentally click record when you didn’t mean to, simply hold the shutter button and it’ll stop recording _and_ delete the captured clip. This is something I didn’t really utilize in my time with the camera, but I can absolutely see the value in it.

##  8K Footage? 4K Is Still the Sweet Spot for Me

![The resolution selection screen on the Insta360 X4](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/the-resolution-selection-screen-on-the-insta360-x4_53646477902_o.jpg) 

Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 In the race to pack as many pixels into a small space as possible, I am staunchly in the camp that 4K (and sometimes 5.7K) is more than enough. The average person still watches content on their phone, and at that small of a screen, 4K is plenty, if not 1080p. This is just how I feel when it comes to this, and let me explain my reasoning.

 Footage shot at 8K takes up crazy amounts of storage space compared to 4K and also requires a much beefier computer to edit. A good middle ground might be the 5.7K option. However, having a camera capable of recording 8K30 footage has a few other benefits outside of the resolution bump. For example, you can record 4K footage at 100FPS. That’s nearly 4x slow-mo if your project is edited in 30FPS. You can use 5.7K to capture at 60FPS, which is 2x slow-mo for 30FPS projects. These two resolutions are really where the Insta360 X4 shines, if you record in 8K30, the camera warns you to be in a windy area or when moving since it heats the camera up faster and also doesn’t work as well in low light. These are a few of the reasons why I still shoot at 4K personally.

 Now, while we’re talking about recording at 4K, the video footage that comes straight out of the camera with the X4 is very crispy. I loved seeing what it could produce, and it was a blast to use. The 8K videos looked great, and the still photos were solid too. You won’t be disappointed with the video or photo quality no matter what resolution you choose. I found it all superb. I'd recommend sticking to 4K though for smaller file sizes, less heat, and better low-light performance.

 Resolution aside, all the footage is recorded in 360 degrees, and that's what makes this camera special. You don't have to worry about whether you have the camera aimed just right or not, as it simply captures just about everything (outside of what's directly below itself.) This is what makes the camera unique, and thankfully, this feature works whether you're recording 4K100, 8K30, or taking a 72MP still photo.

##  Desktop and Mobile Software Is Easy To Use and Make Simple Edits In

 Once I had my footage recorded, I dove into [Insta360 Studio](https://www.insta360.com/download), the desktop-based app for Windows and macOS. There are mobile apps for [iPhone or Android](http://www.insta360.com/download), and an [optional adapter](https://store.insta360.com/product/x4-quick-reader?c=2973&from=accessory) to plug the microSD card into your smartphone. Using my M1 Max MacBook Pro, I imported the 4K footage to the macOS-based app with a Thunderbolt 3 cable. It took less than 60 seconds to load the videos and have them ready for viewing. After selecting a video, I could pan the camera around, switch the mode it was in, do small trims to the video, and even have AI track me as a subject.

 Although neat, I'm not a fan of how Insta360 implemented AI tracking. For starters, it takes 1:1 time to track vs how long the video is, so an hour-long video will take an hour to track, at least on my M1 Max. That’s not the bad part though. The tracking is just jittery. It simply locks the subject into the middle of the frame and makes any movement the subject does.

 I was walking around my workshop with the camera recording and hoped that it would keep me relatively centered in the frame without a ton of excess movements, and I was sorely let down. The footage, when auto-tracked, was essentially unusable. The movements weren't smooth enough. I would love to see Insta360 fix this in a future update, which would be easy for them to do. I'd like to see a larger target box to allow for a bit of movement before slowly panning to follow the subject.

 Outside of that, whenever you go to export, you can choose to send it as a cropped video that’s only within the view that you set in the editor, or a full 360-degree video. Doing the latter will let you bring the video file into software like Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro and do all the editing there, which is how I plan to use the footage from the X4\. The files are formatted in a way that the software will let you handle all the pan and tilt functions as well as do all of your other edits. Plus, Insta360 [has a LUT that you can use](https://www.insta360.com/download) to get the right colors when editing.

##  Rugged for Whatever Lies Ahead

![The battery removed from the Insta360 X4](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/the-battery-removed-from-the-insta360-x4_53647349601_o.jpg)

 While there’s a dive case for going deep underwater, most people will find that the built-in ruggedness of the Insta360 X4 is plenty. It was for me. I wasn’t worried about dropping it, getting it wet, or taking it anywhere when I was using it. The camera is waterproof to 10m out of the box and can also withstand temperatures as low as -20C, meaning it’ll handle anything you throw at it.

 Simply attach a selfie stick, tripod, or hold the camera in your hand, and you’re ready to go. The USB-C flap is waterproof when closed, and the battery also makes a water-tight seal once inserted. Whether you plan to take the camera snowboarding in the winter, surfing in the summer, or just strap it to your motorcycle to use as a dash camera, the Insta360 X4 is built to handle it all.

##  What’s the Difference Between the Insta360 X4 and Insta360 X3?

 While the outside of both cameras is quite similar, there are a few key differences between the last generation and the latest camera from Insta360\. For starters, you can now record 8K30 and 5.7K60, both of which aren’t available on the X3\. There’s also an AI chip on the new one, which is what helps to take better footage. There’s a bigger screen and larger battery on the X4 as well, which are pretty nice to have.

 The lens guards on the X3 are sticky and not removable/reusable, while the X4’s guards slot in and let you swap between normal and premium ones depending on what you want to use. A few other key upgrades to the Insta360 X4 are:

* Gesture Control
* Cancel Recording
* Timed Capture
* Bluetooth Headset Support (for motorcycles and the like)
* Auto Dash Mode (also a motorcycle feature)

##  Should You Buy the Insta360 X4?

Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 The [Insta360 X4](https://www.amazon.com/Insta360-Waterproof-Wide-Angle-Invisible-Stabilization/dp/B0CXPWMZQS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003236&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Finsta360-x4-camera-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is a powerful action camera. There are a lot of people this would be ideal for, but it’s also not all that cheap. With the option to record 8K30, 5.7K60, or 4K100, the X4 will handle just about anything you want in a stunning 360-degree fashion. However, at $500, this camera is pretty pricey. For comparison, the [GoPro HERO12 Black](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-HERO12-Black-Waterproof-Stabilization/dp/B0CDDY8F9L?ref%5F=ast%5Fsto%5Fdp&th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003236&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Finsta360-x4-camera-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is $348, and the [previous-generation Insta360 X3](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-the-world-through-your-lens-how-to-become-a-professional-travel-vlogger/) is $400\. While the GoPro doesn’t capture 360-degree footage, the X3 does and does it at 5.7K60.

 If you don’t need 8K30 or 4K100 footage, and you can live without the other minor upgrades that the X4 got from the X3, then I’d say last-gen might be your best bet. That extra $100 could go toward accessories or just help fund your next outing. The differences here don’t justify the extra $100 unless you’re after one of the more premium offerings like 8K recording, auto dash mode, or Bluetooth headset support.

 If you want the best of the best, then the X4 is where it’s at. You’re getting the latest from one of the biggest innovators in the consumer 360-degree camera space, and picking up a system that should last you for years to come.
