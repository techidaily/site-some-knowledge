[Windows 10 (and Windows 11)](https://www.howtogeek.com/737186/whats-the-difference-between-windows-10-and-windows-11/) has a "lock screen" that you need to dismiss before you can log in. This screen can feel like a nuisance in the sign-in process. We'll show you how to get rid of it.

##  Remove the Lock Screen on Windows 10 Home

 This setting can be changed in the Windows Registry. To open the Registry Editor (RegEdit), start by pressing the Windows + R keys to open the Run window. Type "regedit" in the box and then click the "OK" button.

 The Registry Editor is a very powerful tool that can make your system unstable or worse if you use it incorrectly. Consider reading about [how to use the Registry Editor](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-edit-and-send-fake-location-on-telegram-for-your-nokia-g22-in-3-ways-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) before you getting started. Understand there is some risk involved with Registry edits.

![Enter "regedit" in the Run box.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/9-regedit.png) 

 Once the RegEdit is open, paste the following path into the address bar, or use the menu in the left sidebar to navigate there:

Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows

![Navigate to the "Windows" subkey.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2-navigate-to-locaiton.png) 

 Right click the "Windows" folder and select New > Key from the menu.

![Create a new key in the Windows key.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/3-windows.png) 

 Rename the new folder—it will be called "New Key #1"—to "Personalization".

![Name the new folder "Personalization."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/5-personalization.png) 

 Now, right-click the "Personalization" folder we just created. Select New > DWORD (32-bit) Value from the menu.

![Create a new DWORD.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/6-new-dword.png) 

 Rename the new DWORD to "NoLockScreen".

![Create a DWORD named "NoLockScreen"](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/7-nolockscreen.png) 

 Now, double-click "NoLockScreen" and enter "1" for the "Value Data" field. Click "OK" when you're done.

![Set the "Value Data" to 1.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-1-value-data.png) 

 That's it! The next time you boot up your Windows 10 PC (or lock your screen), you won't see the lock screen.

 That's all there is to it! You'll no longer see the lock screen before the sign-in screen. If you don't use a login, your Windows 10 PC will boot straight to the desktop. It might not be the simplest process, but this is still a pretty simple way to [save some boot-up time](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/iphone-expertise-crafting-time-lapse-photos-for-2024/).
