We've compiled the best background music above for working out and yoga for you. They are a perfect mix of beats and bpm for keeping you in the zone and motivated. So download, listen, and choose which one works best for you.

In addition, I'd recommend that you try to keep your background music to an even volume throughout the class. The last thing you want is for you to get distracted or feel annoyed. And if you're looking for more motivation, try listening to motivational quotes or inspirational speeches before and after your workout.
