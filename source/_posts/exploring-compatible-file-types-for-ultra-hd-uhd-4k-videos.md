 But before this we need make clear [what is 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)? It refers to a resolution (4096×2160 pixels or 3840×2160 pixels) instead of a video format, which confused many people. So briefly, if the video resolution reaches to 2160p, it's absolutely a 4K video no matter what formats the video is encapsulated in. In other words, 4K video formats are board. For example, MP4, MKV, MOV, AVI etc. all can be 4K file formats.

## Part 1\. 4K Video File Formats Roundup

Actually, since the board range of video formats for 4K resolution and the continuous developments of 4K UHD devices, you cannot accurately find out 4K UHD videos formats but a rough list for the present instead. What's format of your 4K video? Here we go for the most common 4K video formats, applying to the different sences.

1\. [**MP4**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). Firstly, MP4 is a video container, which involves codecs like MPEG-4, H.264, HEVC, VP9 etc. And according to the wide compatibility of HEVC/H.265, H.264/AVCHD, MPEG-4, major 4K videos are in MP4 format indeed. Thus, no matter you wanna pocket 4K videos on iPhone iPad Android device, play 4K videos on Mac with VLC, QuickTime [4K UHD video players](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) or stream 4K to 4K UHD TVs, it's a safe belt to convert 4K to MP4 with 4K converter for TV. 

2\. **MTS/M2TS**. MTS/M2TS is a filename extension used for the Blu-ray Disc Audio-Video (BDAV) MPEG-2 Transport Stream (M2TS) container file format. It is used for multiplexing audio, video and other streams. This container format is commonly used for high definition video on Blu-ray Disc and AVCHD. As for 4K resolution, MTS/M2TS are mainly produced by Sony, Canon, Panasonic 4K cameras and camcorders. Besides, these camcorders also record 4K videos in MPG, MPE, MPEG, ASF, MOD as well. 

3\. **MKV**. MKV (Matroska Multimedia Container) is another 4K video format encoded with HEVC/H.265 codec or VP9 codec. It is similar in concept to other containers like AVI, MP4, or ASF, but entirely open. MKV involves an unlimited number of video, audio, picture, or subtitle tracks in one file. But actually, MKV 4K video format is not as compatible as MP4 4K, so if you encounter any MKV 4K won't play issue, you can convert MKV to MP4 for a better compatibility.

4\. **AVCHD.** The result of a Sony and Panasonic collaboration as a video file format for digital camcorders, AVCHD is commonly used for data compressed with the H.264 codec. It supports both standard definition and high definition variants and supports 3D. Moreover, Sony, Panasonic, Canon, JVC all produced some high-end HD camcorders enabling you to record 4K UHD video file in AVCHD format.

## Part 2\. What 4K Video Formats Do Popular 4K TV Support?

Well, the above list does not include all video formats for 4K resolution. As a matter of fact, sometimes you do put a 4K video in common 4K video format, but it cannot be played on your 4K TV. That's because there is a big difference of 4K video formats among different [4K TVs like Samsung, LG and Sony](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macxdvd.com%2Fmac-dvd-video-converter-how-to%2Fbest-4k-tv-from-samsung-sony-lg.htm).

## Part 5\. FAQs

**1\. What format is best for 4K videos?**

What format is best for 4K videos? MP4, AVCHD, and MKV are the best video file formats for 4K videos, although they are not the only options.

**2\. Why is 4K not called 2160p?**

4K stands for 4 Kilo (meaning a thousand). It is named after the image width rather than the height, like 1080p. The four is simply there to state how many thousands of pixels there are. You might also hear 4K referred to as 2160p if you tend to hang around the ultra-technical.

**3\. Is HDR the same as 4K?**

The terms 4K and UHD both refer to display resolution and are essentially the same thing. Conversely, HDR refers to how a device creates the image in colours and brightness. When choosing a display, these are two separate decisions.
